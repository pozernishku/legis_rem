<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	This is the first public meeting of the Congressional Redistricting
Commission, which is constitutionally mandated to come up with a
redistricting plan for the members of Congress.  We will have another public
hearing in South Jersey, in Atlantic City at the Convention Center, on
Thursday at 7:00, and a third public hearing in Northern New Jersey, in
Newark, on August 9th, also at 7:00.  And these notices are being distributed
through a mailing list, and there are also notices in the newspapers.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	We are here to take testimony and to listen to anyone's comments
and suggestions with regard to the congressional redistricting and to accept a
redistricting plan that might be proposed.  If you propose a redistricting plan,
or whatever testimony you give, it will part of a public record that will be
submitted with a final plan that is adopted by the Commission.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	We have one witness who has signed up to testify, and that is Mr.
Ira Jersey.  Would you like to come forward and testify, please?</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt"><STRONG>I R A   J E R S E Y:  </STRONG>Mr. Chairman, thank you for hearing me tonight. 
Members of the board, I appreciate your indulgence this evening, and I
appreciate your work for this very important and constitutionally mandated
effort. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	I am the Chairman of the Jersey City Republican Party, as well as
a candidate for the Legislature in the 31st District, but I am here tonight
mostly for myself, although also for other members of the community of Jersey
City and parts of Bayonne, as well as -- who feel disenfranchised.  The reason
why they feel disenfranchised is because they live in the 10th Congressional
District, which is not in itself bad.  However, the area that they live in in Jersey
City is in the 10th, which is mostly a district in Essex and Union Counties. 
And the people in the district, many of them feel that they're not being
properly represented, because it's difficult for the current representative from
that district to properly represent them.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	Currently, 60 percent of the votes in that district come from Essex
County, 30 percent come from Union County, and only 10 percent, or less
than 10 percent in some cases, come from Hudson County.  In order--  The
way that the lines are drawn, and if you look at it on a map and overlay
roadways, you can definitively see that you cannot even get from the Hudson
County area of the district over to the Newark area of the district -- the Essex
County area -- without going into a different congressional district or
swimming the Hackensack River.  Those are your two options. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	I, for one, have lived there a few years now in this district, and I
have yet to see the current representative come over.  He doesn't have a vested
interest, and because of that, people feel disenfranchised.  Before you
(indicating), I know that you probably have received just some notes from me. 
I hope you'll take them into account when making your decision on how to
redistrict.  I know that the 10th Congressional District has to get another
50,000-some-odd votes or people in terms of population.  So, hopefully, when
you make it--  I don't have a specific plan.  I would make either one of two
suggestions.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	One possibility, obviously, since there's only about 10,000 votes
and maybe 30,000 people in terms of population that need to come out of
Hudson County, that perhaps when you redraw the lines for the 10th that you
can take that into account and move those people out.  Or another possibility
that some people have proposed to me -- this was not my idea, but I think it's
a good one -- is potentially to make -- expand the 10th in Hudson County,
adding most or all of Jersey City and potentially Bayonne and all of Bayonne
into the 10th, thereby making over 150,000 to 200,000 people in the district
from Hudson County.  That way it's more equitable between the three
counties involved in that district.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	Finally, I also, just for ease sake, would urge you to consider using
geopolitical boundaries when creating the district.  Right now, parts of a ward
are in and others parts aren't.  So it would be conducive to the people of Jersey
City just for -- so they're not confused with who's representing them -- to
potentially draw it along ward lines.  We just had ward redistricting in Hudson
County where we had significant changes in our wards in Jersey City.  And it's
possible just to take three of the wards of Jersey City, for example, more or less
half the population, and put it into the 10th District, as well as--  And if you
add Bayonne, that would equal about 178,000 votes, or people, I should say,
and totaling somewhere on the order of a third of the votes in the county.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	That's all that I have.  I didn't really have anything prepared.  I
would welcome questions, if that's appropriate, Mr. Chairman.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	MR. ROSENTHAL:  Yes, it is.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	Any members of the Commission have a question to ask of Mr.
Jersey?  (no response) </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	I think you've been very clear, and I want to thank you, on behalf
of the Commission, for coming down here and submitting your testimony. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	Thank you.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	MR. JERSEY:  Thank you for the brief indulgence.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	MR. ROSENTHAL:  Are there any other people here who would
like to testify?  (no response) </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	Well, if not, I think our work this evening is--  Pardon me?</SPAN></P>
