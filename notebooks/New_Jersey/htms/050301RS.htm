on Internet Access to Sex Offender Registration Information will be
conducting. The meeting has been duly advertised, and I see that we have a

regard to our second meeting, which will be on May 16 at Mercer County
Community College in West Windsor.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	I am pleased to be here tonight with the members of the Task
Force.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	And perhaps, Anne, you could just go around and take roll of the

co-chairing the Task Force with me.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	The purpose of the Task Force is to take a look at the -- we believe
are important issues that need to be evaluated and deliberated in developing
draft legislation, implementing a broad-based registry on the Internet and,
perhaps other mediums, but principally on the Internet.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	We believe there are issues of consequences with regard to tiering
and how that should be developed, and how that should be reported on the
Internet -- issues with regard to juvenile offenders, issues with regard to the
type and extent of information that should be included in the database,
information with regard to how the database is accessed, whether or not people
accessing the database should identify themselves, how do we maintain the
security and integrity of the database, how do we maintain the accuracy.  And
there are other issues.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	But the purpose tonight is to hear from the public and to
deliberate on the input that we receive from the public regarding these issues
or any other issues that the public feels is germane for this Task Force to
consider in developing this draft legislation.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	MR. GRASSO:  Okay. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	Is this on?  (referring to PA microphone)</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	Good evening.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	Let me take this opportunity to introduce myself.  My name is
Jarrod Grasso.  I am the Government Affairs Director for the New Jersey
Association of Realtors.  The New Jersey Association of Realtors, or NJAR, is
a trade organization of licensed real estate professionals with 35,000 members.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	On behalf of my association, thank you for giving us this
opportunity to share with you our concerns with the current Megan's Law
statute.  The area that most concerns NJAR and our membership is notification
to the public in the buying, selling, and leasing of residential properties.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	NJAR has voiced concern as to how Megan's Law has been
administered and enforced almost from its inception in 1994.  NJAR has gone
so far as to meet with representatives from the Attorney General's Office, the
sponsors of the Megan's Law legislation, and at least two members of the
General Assembly since that time. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	Our position has never varied.  The public who Megan's Law was
intended to protect feel they are no better off now than they were before the
horrible tragedy that befell the Kanka family.  There is no way, under the
current statute, that a person who is moving into a neighborhood can find out,
prior to closing on a home or signing a lease agreement, if there is a sexual
predator living in the neighborhood.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	When this statute was adopted in New Jersey, the real estate
licensee was caught between what the buying, selling, and leasing public felt
they had the right to know under the Megan's Law statute and what the legal
interpretation allowed the public to receive. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	This predicament is frustrating to everyone, whether they are from
the law enforcement community, attorneys, members of the Legislature, or real
estate licensees.  This led the real estate industry to amend its contracts and
leases to provide a Megan's Law disclosure statement.  This statement, which
is included in NJAR's sale and leasing contracts, clearly states that under New
Jersey's law, the county prosecutor determines whether and how to provide
notice of the presence of convicted sex offenders in an area.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	The clause further states that in our professional capacity, real
estate licensees are not entitled to notification by the county prosecutor under
Megan's Law and are unable to obtain such information for you.  Upon closing,
the county prosecutor may be contacted for such further information as may
be disclosable to the purchaser or lessee.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	Currently, only after a person closes on a property or signs a lease
can they be notified, which NJAR believes defeats the original purpose of the
law, which is to protect New Jersey's families.  This is why NJAR contends that
New Jersey's families need an Internet registry.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	NJAR suggests that as a means of informing purchasers or tenants,
there should be a required clause in every contract of sale or lease agreement,
whether or not they are prepared by a real estate licensee, which would direct
the individual to the official sex offender registry Web site.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	Further, the Legislature should ensure that it is the sole
responsibility of the lessee or home purchaser to access the Internet registry. 
No one, including sellers and landlords, as well as a real estate professional,
attorney, or Joe Public, should be held responsible to disseminate or interpret
the information contained in the Internet registry.  The individual should
evaluate the information they obtain from the Web site and make their own
value judgement and not rely on others.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	Therefore, NJAR recommends that any legislation must include
language that states:  "No action shall be brought against a seller, lessor, real
estate broker, broker-salesperson, or salesperson for failure to investigate or
disclose any information from the registry that is compiled or made available
to the citizens of New Jersey under this Act."</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	I thank you, Senator, for the opportunity to speak before this
committee, (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt"><EM>sic</EM>) and I'd be happy to answer any questions.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	SENATOR INVERSO:  Just to advise the members of the Task
Force, that language you speak of is already included as an amendment or
already capsulated in the Assembly version of the bill, correct?</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	MR. GRASSO:  Yes, sir.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	SENATOR INVERSO:  Right.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	MR. GRASSO:  Yes, sir.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	SENATOR INVERSO:  Does anyone have any questions for Mr.
Grasso?  (no response)</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	Thank you for your input.  Thank you very much.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	MR. GRASSO:  Thank you very much.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	SENATOR INVERSO:  Is there anyone else who wishes to speak?
(no response)</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	No one else? </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	Okay.  If not, then this concludes the hearing for tonight.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	As I've indicated, the next hearing will be May 16.  It will be at
7:00 at the Mercer County Community College in West Windsor.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	And our Task Force will meet an hour prior to that, at 6:00.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Arrus BT" STYLE="font-size: 13pt">	The hearing is adjourned.</SPAN></P>
