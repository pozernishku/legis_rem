      "there could be significant recriminations for the lack of action over the past\n",
      "two years since the passage of the school construction legislation, but rather to\n",
      "get first from the practitioners, the people in the field, the people in the school\n",
      "districts, their comments on what has or has not taken place, and their\n",
      "recommendations on how we can improve the system.\n",

      "The people there have done an excellent job in economic development. \n",

      "agency that was going to be responsible for school construction and only as the\n",
      "bill evolved did this occur.  \n",
      "                  So what we’ve had is an agency that’s done a great job in one area\n",
      "being forced to take on a responsibility they were not prepared for, did not\n",
      "have the staff for, and then working with the Department of Education and the\n",
      "problems that occur, the glitches that occur in the bureaucracy between two\n",
      "departments working together to try to deal with an issue of great importance,\n",
      "that of providing adequate facilities for students.  The end result is that we’ve\n",
      "had for the past two years almost nothing happening, especially in the Abbott\n",
      "districts where the greatest need occurs.  \n",
      "                  So why we’re here today is to listen to those people who are from\n",
      "the school districts, from the school organizations, listen to the problems that\n",
      "exist, but more importantly to ask them to make recommendations on how we\n",
      "can improve the system so that now that the governor has taken action, now\n",
      "that we do have this new corporation, they will have the input from those who\n",

      "understand what must get done, and we can move forward and deal with the\n",
      "issues that are of importance.  So that’s where I think we are and why we’re\n",
      "having these hearings.  \n",
      "                  I’d like to turn it to Assemblyman Stanley.\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN STANLEY:  Thank you very much, Chairman\n",
      "Doria.  \n",
      "                  Let me first express my gratitude to you, Chairman, for taking the\n",
      "initiative to convene this hearing.  Nothing could be more important to the\n",
      "children of the State of New Jersey than making sure that we fulfill our\n",
      "constitutional obligation.  Of course, the children who have been the\n",
      "underserved, the least served with respect to education and the opportunity for\n",
      "an education have been the Abbott children.  Unfortunately, even after\n",
      "tremendous court victories, as I’m sure you will hear, we still do not have in\n",
      "place a system of thorough and efficient education for the children in the\n",
      "poorest districts in our state, which make up about a third of the children in\n",
      "our state.\n",
      "                  We have come to understand that unless the Legislature is engaged\n",
      "with this process, we will never achieve the type of education system that is\n",
      "needed and that is dictated and that we’re constitutionally obligated to\n",
      "provide.  One of the first, of course, orders of business of this legislative session\n",
      "was to try to get through the budget crisis somewhat intact.  But my hat is off\n",
      "to you, Chairman, that the first matter of business after that was to look at the\n",
      "implementation of Abbott, and of course, the first and most important issue\n",
      "or, I would say, probably the most timely issue, as Senator Rice has brought\n",
      "up, as you have brought up, Mr. Chairman, is ensuring that school\n",
      "construction takes place now, not two or three or four or five years from now,\n",
      "but with specific emphasis on those health and safety issues that after two\n",
      "years -- two years after ground should have been broken -- two years after these\n",
      "things should have been begun, we’re still at a point where probably\n",
      "somewhere between 80 percent or 90 percent of the safety and health issues\n",
      "have not been addressed.\n",
      "                  So I thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think that this hearing is so\n",
      "important because we will be hearing from those people who are in the\n",
      "trenches, who have been trying to get this done.  I see my superintendent and\n",
      "my business administration from the Irvington Public School system here, and\n",
      "I’m so glad that they came, because I know that we had to really become very\n",
      "engaged in the process last summer to ensure that the safety and health needs\n",
      "just at a couple of schools were done, were taken care of.  \n",
      "                  So, again, I think this is a very important hearing.  I’m so glad that\n",
      "we have a good turnout today, and I’m looking forward to the testimony, Mr.\n",
      "Chairman.  And as you said, this is not to point, to assess blame.  We’ve had\n",
      "three or four commissioners.  I don’t think a commissioner is going to make the\n",
      "difference.  I think if we have a Legislature--  I  think if we have legislation in\n",
      "place, I think if we have a system in place, I think that we can be ensured that\n",
      "we’re going to go about solving the problem and getting these health and safety\n",
      "issues addressed and ultimately getting schools constructed in these Abbott\n",
      "districts.\n",
      "                  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN DORIA:  Thank you very much, Assemblyman\n",
      "Stanley.\n",
      "                  Senator Rice.\n",
      "                  SENATOR RICE:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n",
      "                  Let me too commend you for not spending the summer at the\n",
      "shore community and elsewhere that many of us could have been -- who could\n",
      "afford it -- and instead have taken on the task of moving forward with\n",
      "education.  We all know that in September the schools are going to open.  We\n",
      "all know that we are backed up in the implementation of Abbott, and I just\n",
      "want those who are here to know and to understand that we have the\n",
      "Assembly Education Committee, but when it comes to Abbott, the Joint\n",
      "Committee on Public Schools is statutory.  It was intentionally put there to\n",
      "oversight Abbott and to work along with the other two education committees. \n",
      "                  The one thing that is starting to become disturbing to me is that\n",
      "in January when we took office, the Department of Education moved forward \n",
      "and of course, the Joint Committee was not reorganized at that time on the\n",
      "Senate side even when the Assembly had moved forward.  And then I read\n",
      "about how we’re going to delay school construction for a year and many, many\n",
      "other things, but no input from this collective body.  That disturbed me\n",
      "because we kind of lost control of getting information.  \n",
      "                  And then what disturbed me is that a couple of weeks ago I was\n",
      "speaking with the Commissioner of Education about a meeting, which he\n",
      "agreed to, and only to pick the paper up to find out that he was visiting my\n",
      "city with my school district and my people, in terms of board members and\n",
      "others, to talk about how we’re going to give the schools back to the districts. \n",
      "Well, that offended me because I never got a courtesy call, not that he has to\n",
      "call, but that’s the way it’s always been up until this time and say, “I’ll be in\n",
      "your district.  You don’t need to be there for these reasons.”  \n",
      "                  Now, if you recall, Mr. Chairman, we are just reorganized, which\n",
      "means the Trachtenberg Report was just handed out, which means that the\n",
      "Commissioner was already in front of us without us having questions about\n",
      "whether the Trachtenberg Report is good or bad.  So I expressed to the\n",
      "Commission that it’s going to be incumbent upon the Legislature -- and I agree\n",
      "with Assemblyman Stanley that regardless of the commission, it is our\n",
      "responsibility, statutorily, to kind of lead and not to follow -- are meant to\n",
      "work with and be cooperative in expediting this process. \n",
      "                  The courts have already spoken.  And so as I’ve told the\n",
      "commissioner, at least from the Joint Committee on Public Schools\n",
      "perspective, as Chair, we’re going to slow him down.  I never knew that the\n",
      "Governor was appointing someone to -- Mr. McNeill or whatever--  I’m glad to\n",
      "know that you got a call, Mr. Chairman, because I would have been a little bit\n",
      "more offended if you didn’t, because I have not heard from anyone.  Once\n",
      "again, whatever Mr. McNeill is going to do has a direct relationship to what\n",
      "the Assembly and Senate Education Committees must do and what the Joint\n",
      "Committee on the Public Schools must do.  \n",
      "                  So I want to commend you for these two hearings because it is\n",
      "important that the contractors and the school board members and the\n",
      "superintendents and others involved and have been involved let us know what\n",
      "the barriers have been.  We’ve got to remove those barriers but not forgetting\n",
      "that the Attorney General has some very serious concerns about accountability\n",
      "and integrity in the process, because there’s so much money.  But that concern\n",
      "about integrity and accountability in the process should not mean a lot of\n",
      "paperwork and documents sitting on a bunch of folks’ desks to be reviewed. \n",
      "It means that we should keep with the integrity, deal with security, but\n",
      "expedite the process.  \n",
      "                  Finally, it does not make any sense for EDA to finally get the\n",
      "bumps out of the road in terms of approving projects.  They know that you can\n",
      "approve it now and get a roof by September.  Unfortunately, approval is now\n",
      "and in September, there’s still no roof because on this side, something is\n",
      "happening that we have to identify and we have to correct and we have to\n",
      "correct right away.  \n",
      "                  So once again, thank you.  I’m here to listen.  I’ll be here tomorrow\n",
      "to listen.  I can assure those who are here that not only will the Assembly and\n",
      "Senate Education Committees be meeting actively on this subject, but those\n",
      "of us on Joint Committee will be meeting also.  The Joint Committee is broken\n",
      "down into four subcommittees now.  The new subcommitee is one that is very\n",
      "important to us as it relates to the time frame at hand, and that, once again,\n",
      "is chaired by Assemblyman Stanley, and that’s Construction Facilities.  \n",
      "                  So I want to thank you again and commend you very much, Mr.\n",
      "Chairman.\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN DORIA:  Thank you, Senator Rice.\n",
      "                  Senator Baer.\n",
      "                  SENATOR BAER:  Thank you.\n",
      "                  First of all, I wanted to say I think that you and Assemblyman\n",
      "Stanley have very eloquently identified why this is so important, and I wanted\n",
      "to thank you for inviting Senators to come to this meeting.  I cut a vacation\n",
      "short so that I could come here.  I want to thank you for making this available\n",
      "on the Internet so that citizens all over the state and, in fact, out of the state\n",
      "can follow these proceedings.  There is no doubt that education, particularly\n",
      "relative to the Abbott districts is the largest unfulfilled challenge that state\n",
      "government has before it, of many challenges.  I know that you have long\n",
      "focused on education and the sincerity of your concern, whether that was\n",
      "through your leadership role as Chairman of the Assembly Education\n",
      "Committee and in the various leadership roles of a partisan nature that you\n",
      "had in the Assembly and as Speaker, you’ve always put education in a special\n",
      "category of responsibility.  I’m glad that there are so many people here who\n",
      "reflect similar thoughts on that.\n",
      "                  I won’t say anything further except that I’m waiting eagerly to hear\n",
      "the witnesses at this hearing.\n",
      "                  Thank you.\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN DORIA:  Thank you, Senator Baer.\n",
      "                  Assemblywoman Friscia.\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYWOMAN FRISCIA:  Thank you very much, Mr.\n",
      "Chairman. \n",
      "                  I am very pleased that you have called for these hearings this week. \n",
      "Even though it’s in the middle of the summer, I think it’s very important\n",
      "because we do have another school year coming about.  I have been very\n",
      "concerned since the enactment of this law in 2000 that the Legislature has\n",
      "really heard very little from EDA.  I believe our Oversight Committee has had\n",
      "one, possibly two meetings with the EDA, and I’m even more concerned when\n",
      "I look through their chart to see how many vacancies there are in the chain of\n",
      "command for this construction project.  So I’m very happy that we’re having\n",
      "this hearing.  I think it is most important.  \n",
      "                  I have seen what moneys can do to renovate old buildings in my\n",
      "own district in Perth Amboy.  State money has done a magnificent job to these\n",
      "buildings.  We have extremely old buildings in that district with only one new\n",
      "building, the Robert Wilentz Elementary School which opened last year, being\n",
      "the newest building.  But the other buildings are all old, old buildings but have\n",
      "been renovated.  Some of them have been renovated and a beautiful job has\n",
      "been done on them.  So I’m hoping that we can move ahead, get this\n",
      "construction project underway and get our kids into facilities that are\n",
      "conducive to learning, because it means so much.\n",
      "                  I know you have a education background, Mr. Chair.  I was a\n",
      "teacher for about 17 years in old school buildings, and I know the difference\n",
      "it can make with kids.  So I’m very excited about this whole project, and I hope\n",
      "this helps move it along.\n",
      "                  Thank you.\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN DORIA:  Thank you.\n",
      "                  Assemblyman Fraguela.\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN FRAGUELA:  Yes.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman,\n",
      "for inviting us to this meeting.  I believe it is very important as a school\n",
      "principal, as my main function during the day, I believe that construction of\n",
      "schools is very, very important.  \n",
      "                  I live in a town where one of the schools was built in 1865 at the\n",
      "end of the Civil War.  That building is still being used by students.  We have\n",
      "improved a lot the conditions of the building, but a lot more needs to be done. \n",
      "I have to agree and echo some of the words of my colleague, Assemblywoman\n",
      "Friscia, for saying the fact that we need new facilities, and we need them fast. \n",
      "So I don’t want to be repetitious, and I want to thank you for calling this\n",
      "meeting and having so many people here ready to testify.  So I’m eager to\n",
      "listen to what you have to say too.\n",
      "                  Thank you.\n",

      "                  As a new member, I wasn’t here during all the deliberations.  My\n",
      "only observation is clearly the system isn’t working and hopefully during the\n",
      "next two days we can come up with some solutions that will make it work.\n",
      "                  Thank you.\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN DORIA:  Thank you.\n",
      "                  Assemblyman Conners.\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN CONNERS:  Thank you, Chairman Doria. \n",
      "Thank you for calling this meeting.  I have to commend everybody, so many\n",
      "folks for being here.\n",
      "                  I am also on the Tourism and Gaming Committee.  So I must\n",
      "confess that I get nervous when I see everybody here and not at the seashore\n",
      "resorts spending a lot of money helping the economy of New Jersey.  \n",
      "                  We are here though to talk about something very important.  I\n",
      "have an Abbott district in the district that I serve.  Burlington City is an\n",
      "Abbott district.  And I think as some of you have had the experience during,\n",
      "I guess, before the budget--  I’ve had a lot of school board administrators,\n",
      "school board members come in to see me.  I had my business administrator of\n",
      "my Abbott district come in to see me with some board members, and he came\n",
      "to see me out of just, I guess, complete utter frustration because he wasn’t\n",
      "having any success.  He would send paperwork in.  He would find out that they\n",
      "didn’t get the paperwork.  There were all kinds of things happening, and he\n",
      "was just completely frustrated and came to me for help. \n",
      "                  And also, it had to do with health and safety issues.  We were\n",
      "talking about schools where I don’t think any of us would come in here and sit\n",
      "in this room if we thought the ceiling was going to collapse.  But that’s what\n",
      "we have in some of our Abbott districts and some of these old buildings where\n",
      "we expect children to go in and sit in rooms, and teachers -- in rooms that we\n",
      "wouldn’t sit in ourselves.  So it doesn’t make any sense, and that’s why it’s so\n",
      "important.  \n",
      "                  It’s my hope too that the school corporation will help.  But I agree,\n",
      "Chairman, you said that it may be another level of bureaucracy.  It will be, but\n",
      "it is my hope that they take some efforts to straighten it out.  There are so\n",
      "many issues in addition to Abbott.  We could probably have a hearing every\n",
      "day just on special education, as an example.  But it is important that we get\n",
      "this Abbott problem fixed, and we get it fixed soon, and we get on with the\n",
      "construction that will, literally, possibly keep our children from getting hurt,\n",
      "let alone get an education.  So let’s get both.  Let’s make sure that the health\n",
      "and safety issues are addressed and that our children get a good education.  I\n",
      "look forward to this hearing.  \n",
      "                  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN DORIA:  Thank you.\n",
      "                  Assemblyman Malone.\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN MALONE:  Thank you very much, Mr.\n",
      "Chairman, and I also congratulate you for convening this hearing.  \n",
      "                  As one of the prime sponsors on this piece of legislation two years\n",
      "ago, it has been an extreme disappointment that this thing has not moved\n",
      "along faster than it has.  I have heard some not so complimentary stories \n",
      "about what is going on, especially in the urban school districts with things not\n",
      "being implemented as quickly as possible.  I am very interested in hearing\n",
      "today really what is, in peoples’ opinions going on, what the difficulties are. \n",
      "I remember quite vividly during the discussions and the negotiations on this\n",
      "piece of legislation that I was a strong advocate of having a different entity run\n",
      "this school construction proposal.  I fought to the very bitter end when we were\n",
      "drafting this piece of legislation to have that entity in place along side of the\n",
      "EDA in using this operation.  \n",
      "                  I haven’t seen the particulars of the Governor’s proposal on this,\n",
      "but I would have to say, on the first blush, I think I tend to agree with the\n",
      "governor that we need to implement something a little differently to get this\n",
      "particular piece of legislation and the implementation of it off the ground as\n",
      "quickly as possible.  We cannot continue to have substandard building\n",
      "conditions in urban areas in particular and in some rural and suburban districts\n",
      "that are also classified as Abbotts and throughout the state in general.  \n",
      "                  So I am very much looking forward to this.  I think that we as a\n",
      "Legislature have implemented a number of pieces of legislation through the\n",
      "school construction, through the bidding processes, and the changes in the\n",
      "bidding laws that this thing should be able to be handled in a clear, concise,\n",
      "efficient, and quick manner.  I just hope that this doesn’t end up like a lot of\n",
      "other meetings and a lot of other bureaucracies and end up churning and\n",
      "churning.  Something has to be done and done quickly. \n",
      "                  The respect I have for the Chairman of this Committee -- I think\n",
      "if Joe puts his mind to something and really gets on it, and all of us, in a very\n",
      "nonpartisan way, start pushing the bureaucracies, the Governor, and whatever\n",
      "other entities are necessary to get this thing moving, it will happen.  But if we\n",
      "sit back and we let it become mired in bureaucracy and politics, it will just be\n",
      "another boondoggle and cost us a lot of money and eventually not get a lot of\n",
      "things accomplished.  So I am encouraged by this.  I am encouraged by what\n",
      "I saw just briefly with the governor making his pronouncement of trying to get\n",
      "this thing off dead center.  I will do everything I can to make sure that this\n",
      "thing happens, as I expect, in a precise a fashion as possible.\n",
      "                  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\n",

      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN GARRETT:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  \n",
      "                  As you know, Mr. Chairman, you and I spoke about the necessities\n",
      "of these meetings during the summertime, and I agree with you that just as\n",
      "your legislative office heard an outpouring--  Can I use the word complaints? \n",
      "How about concern?  How about that word?  Concerns about what was going\n",
      "on throughout your area and throughout the state as well.  I certainly hear the\n",
      "same concerns or complaints up in my district as well.  We only have a month\n",
      "to go or so before the school year starts.  You folks in the school board\n",
      "profession know better than I whether it’s realistic to get things actually up and\n",
      "running by that time.  I certainly hope that it is.  \n",
      "                  Speaking as one here, maybe the only one here on the panel who\n",
      "had reservations with regard to this overall legislation going forward, I do know\n",
      "that some of the reservations were that the overall scope or the magnitude of\n",
      "the project that we were trying to do with this legislation, the initial legislation,\n",
      "could possibly lead to a couple of problems down the road.  One was the\n",
      "magnitude leading to your bureaucratic log jam, and the second problem being\n",
      "so much money being thrown out at one time leading to cost bids going up,\n",
      "escalating beyond what anyone anticipated and, therefore, having to go and\n",
      "rebid projects.  \n",
      "                  What we’re maybe finding out is that the first problem has\n",
      "occurred.  The second problem has occurred as well, but the first problem is,\n",
      "perhaps, now magnifying or exacerbating the second problem as the delays are\n",
      "causing school boards to find that as they wait for the rebids to come back in\n",
      "that they’re only getting rebid at a higher price for any of the programs that\n",
      "they’re looking at anyway.  \n",
      "                  So I applaud you for taking this step during the summertime to get\n",
      "it done.  I hope that we have all the answers from the audience now to make\n",
      "this thing done before September.\n",

      "                  MR. SCIARRA:  Right.\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN DORIA:  This group is an outgrowth of EDA or\n",
      "is it part of the Education Law Center, and does it have any authority, or is it\n",
      "just an advisory body that hopefully will have some impact?\n",
      "                  MR. SCIARRA:  This really comes out of the Compliance Council\n",
      "that the governor created in February, which essentially was--  What it is is a\n",
      "requirement that the parties to Abbott, us on behalf of the children and State\n",
      "officials, meet regularly to assess progress in State implementation.  Now, one\n",
      "of the things that we insisted on was that there are a lot of design flaws in the\n",
      "Abbott program, not just school construction but preschool and others.  We\n",
      "wanted to move away from what the prior administration had done in\n",
      "implementation which was to have State officials sort of sit in their offices to\n",

      "implement and move to a situation where stakeholders, superintendents,\n",
      "principals, teachers, community groups, people in the field are brought together\n",
      "to work with DOE, EDA on how to solve these problems.  \n",
      "                  So the Facilities Work Group is an outgrowth of the Compliance\n",
      "Council.  It was set up by DOE and EDA to make recommendations for policy\n",
      "changes at both EDA, or the new schools corporation now, and DOE.  I will\n",
      "tell you that in the pre-K area the administration looks to the work group as\n",
      "the place in which it’s going to develop its policy changes.  It is an advisory --\n",
      "it has no authority, but I will tell you that we will be very unhappy and\n",
      "dissatisfied if the work of these groups is ignored.  So far, we’ve insisted that\n",
      "the recommendations that come out of these work groups really form the basis\n",

      "                  I don’t know if that answers your question.  I hope it does.\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN DORIA:  Well, what it seems to be then is\n",

      "                  MR. SCIARRA:  That’s right.  Because really, it’s not only about\n",

      "order.  Look, we want to avoid being back in court on a constant, recurring\n",
      "basis in the implementation of these programs.  One of the things we’ve said\n",
      "to the administration, if you want to do that, you’ve got to bring people\n",
      "together from the field who know about these programs to develop proposals\n",
      "for change.  Those proposals have to then become, assuming they’re\n",
      "appropriate and we have the best people around the table to do that, the basis\n",
      "for policy change.  That’s the idea there.\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN DORIA:  So this would hopefully be then\n",

      "based upon these hearings and further input from this group and other groups,\n",
      "that if there’s a need to go beyond regulations, we may have to do amendments\n",
      "to the piece of legislation that became law in the year 2000.  But I think at this\n",

      "                  MR. SCIARRA:  Well, what I would say even on the 500,000 issue\n",
      "is really -- let’s get the program moving and see, especially because I do think\n",
      "a lot of--  We’ve heard a lot from the districts, and I know they’ll speak for\n",
      "themselves, but what we hear is a lot of the predevelopment issues they’d like\n",
      "to really -- they think they can do and are in a better position to do with\n",
      "proper EDA oversight.  Like, for example, architect contracts for design of\n",
      "schools and can engage local (indiscernible) better.  Well, if we have policies,\n",
      "regulations that require that under strict standards we may not need to amend\n",
      "the 500,000, although we may get to a point where there are certain things,\n",

      "                  We thank you for this opportunity to present the views of the\n",
      "Clifton Board of Education, particularly on the problems associated with the\n",
      "implementation of the Educational Facilities Construction Financing Act,\n",
      "which is not just about Abbott districts.  The geographic location of some\n",
      "communities has a direct impact on facility needs, especially when they are\n",
      "located next to Abbott districts.  School systems bordered by Abbott districts\n",
      "have many of the same characteristics found in these special needs districts.  \n",
      "                  Additionally, the upper mobility of students from Abbott districts\n",
      "is to move into neighboring non-Abbott schools, thus impacting these schools\n",
      "with increasing enrollments and expansion of programs needed to meet the\n",
      "instructional requirements of these students.  Clifton is such a district with\n",
      "Paterson, Garfield, and Passaic -- three Abbott districts bordering us.  The\n",
      "demographics of Clifton are directly impacted by this proximity, particularly\n",
      "our schools that are located in attendance areas bordering these communities. \n",
      "These are the schools that are crowded with enrollment growth faster than our\n",
      "other schools due to multi-unit housing found in these areas.  \n",
      "                  Additionally, these schools are older and do not have the facilities\n",
      "that are required to meet such growing needs.  A brief profile of our facilities\n",
      "shows that of the 16 Clifton schools, 13 are aging, student-occupied buildings,\n",
      "3 built in 1905 to 1913, 6 built between 1921 and 1929, 3 built between 1930\n",
      "and 1948, 4 built between 1953 and 1962.  Our youngest building is 40 years\n",
      "old.  \n",
      "                  A provision of this act, C18A:7G-4, Part L, states, “By July 1, 2001\n",

      "shall be eligible for local property tax reduction as a result of their income level,\n",
      "or on a districtwide basis, the percentage population of persons 65 years and\n",
      "over exceeds the New Jersey statewide percentage population of 65 years and\n",

      "                  The Supreme Court decision to require state-supported\n",

      "                  Again, we thank you for this opportunity to present the views of\n",
      "the Clifton Board of Education, and I’ll be happy to answer any questions that\n",
      "you might have.\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN DORIA:  Thank you.\n",
      "                  I just want to point out, the staff has pointed out, that that section\n",
      "of the legislation that was passed was never implemented.\n",
      "                  MS. HAKIM:  No, it wasn’t.\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN DORIA:  And I just wanted to make clear that’s\n",

      "                  MS. HAKIM:  Exactly.\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN DORIA:  More than a year later, no study has\n",
      "been done, and obviously, your recommendations are that these five provisions\n",
      "be recommendations that would then allow districts that are adjacent to more\n",
      "than one Abbott district then to benefit from increased aid for school\n",
      "construction.  I think that’s an important issue.  \n",
      "                  And again, the issue of those districts that are adjacent to Abbott\n",
      "districts and the impact in the future is very important for all of us to deal\n",
      "with, not only as it relates to school construction, but also as it relates to\n",
      "educational programs for the future which are going to be issues that we’re\n",
      "going to have to deal with in the future.\n",
      "                  So, I thank you very much.  I think your point is very well taken.\n",
      "                  MS. HAKIM:  Thank you.  We did have a more detailed report\n",
      "recommending various percentages above the 40 percent, all the way up to 100\n",
      "percent, depending on the meeting of all of the criteria, as opposed to one or\n",
      "two pieces.\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN DORIA:  If you could give us a copy for staff,\n",

      "Rice and Assemblyman Stanley, and the Committee members--\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN DORIA:  Why don’t you introduce yourselves\n",
      "first.\n",
      "                  MR. STEELE:  Oh, sure.  Thank you for having us here today.\n",
      "                  My name is Michael Steele.  I am the School Business\n",
      "Administrator for the Irvington Public Schools.  With me is Mr. Vic Demming,\n",
      "who is Assistant Superintendent for Finances, and Mr. Mike Bloom, who is our\n",
      "Abbott Project Consultant for the Board of Education.  \n",
      "                  I’m going to speak very briefly from a personal standpoint being\n",
      "the facilities person for the district, and I’m going to turn it over to Mr. Bloom\n",
      "who has a prepared recorded statement for you, and will provide that with you\n",
      "momentarily.  \n",
      "                  School construction in Irvington is nothing new to us because we\n",
      "have been involved from 1989 to 1995 in a $60 million school bond issue\n",
      "which we financed through lease purchasing.  Also, if you recall, there was a\n",
      "one shot pool of money that, in fact, EDA was involved in between 1993 and\n",
      "1995 where the Irvington School district received $1.7 million, and that was\n",
      "well appreciated pool of money that helped us fix a lot of our roofs.  So we’ve\n",
      "had experience with EDA.  \n",
      "                  I’m going to be somewhat redundant, perhaps, to the moment,\n",
      "because my good friend, Mayor Palmer, spoke I think adequately about how\n",
      "many of us feel in the Abbott districts.  It’s been two years in an Abbott\n",
      "district, and two years is too long for us to wait for certain things to be done,\n",
      "when we’re used to trying to have things done in a more expedient manner.  \n",
      "                  For example, in the beginning of the process, as you recall, DOE\n",
      "initially worked with the DCA.  And being a practitioner on a day-to-day basis\n",
      "working with folks, it’s frustrating to meet with a group of people who are\n",
      "indicating that they’re the ones who are going to help you change your district\n",
      "and do all the things that are necessary.  Six months later, they’re removed and\n",
      "another organization comes in.  I’m very happy, though, to say that we’ve been\n",
      "working with EDA since 2000, roughly around January of 2000.  \n",
      "                  We recently had a meeting with Caren Franzini, and there’s been\n",
      "some activity possibly speaking in terms of things taking place.  Over this\n",
      "winter, we had five schools receive brand new roofs.  We currently, right now,\n",
      "are in the design and construction phase of our health and safety issues\n",
      "wherein we’re hoping that trucks are going to start rolling in Irvington\n",
      "somewhere towards the end of next month of September to conclude about\n",
      "$14 million in health and safety issues.  The concern, though, is that these\n",
      "same health and safety issues were on my drawing boards two or three years\n",
      "ago.  We also had our own board architects.  I convinced the Board of\n",
      "Education six years ago to hire two architects to represent the board.  We have\n",
      "12 schools and 5 satellite offices.  Each of those architects were responsible for\n",
      "6 of those schools.  The importance of that is that many of the designs were\n",
      "already done by these architects working with the board.\n",
      "                  When DOE and EDA came in, many of those designs that we paid\n",
      "for, the taxpayers paid for, were discarded.  Those designs were done with\n",
      "professionals just as EDA had selected to do for us at this point in time.  I’m\n",
      "concerned about another issue that Mayor Palmer talked about in terms of\n",
      "local input, local contractors, local architects, etc.\n",
      "                  While we currently have nine schools involved in our health and\n",
      "safety issues currently, we have two architectural firms.  One firm was given\n",
      "five of the schools to do, and one firm was given four of the schools to do.  One\n",
      "of those firms comes out of the state of New York.  That’s all well and good\n",
      "because they’re a very, very confident firm, but there are some things that are\n",
      "somewhat different in terms of procedures and structures within the state of\n",
      "New York.  And in my conversations in dealing with them, we’re finding those\n",
      "things out as we’re walking through the processes together.  That becomes so\n",
      "cumbersome because some of the laws, legislation, as I’m sure you can imagine\n",
      "is somewhat different within the state of New York.  \n",
      "                  So I’d like to see us focus more on -- fulfill that commitment to\n",
      "having a local -- and put from our professionals within the State of New Jersey. \n",
      "Also, I find that the process has been cumbersome in terms of the procedures,\n",
      "the procurement of the architects firms, the selection process, and particularly\n",
      "our ability to have input with the appropriate folks.  The pool process has been\n",
      "somewhat cumbersome, and Mr. Bloom is going to speak to that specifically\n",
      "in a moment or two.  \n",
      "                  But two years have lapsed, and for me in Irvington, two years\n",
      "means a difference between a small leak in my roof and a roof collapsing and\n",
      "me having to abandon classrooms, which is taking place as we speak.  Two\n",
      "years means the difference between my boiler malfunctioning and me being\n",
      "able to repair it, and me now having two schools that are literally without\n",
      "boilers.  I’ve got to bring portable trailers with furnaces to pump the heat into\n",
      "our schools at an additional cost of about $100,000 per school.  That condition\n",
      "will go on until EDA or DOE gets to the point in time where that now becomes\n",
      "priority on that list.  So far, we’re at health and safety issues.\n",
      "                  At one point in time, there’s a month or so where we were dealing\n",
      "with semantics.  Was it an emergent problem or an emergency problem?  To\n",
      "me, if I have a hole in my roof, it is an essential problem that has to be taken\n",
      "care of.  I don’t have the time for semantics.  And those are some of the things\n",
      "that we’ve been dealing with over the last two years.  \n",
      "                  As I said before, though, the process seems to be waning itself out,\n",
      "and it seems to be moving forward.  But I can tell you that we have because our\n",
      "past experience has been very specific in terms of our needs and our direction. \n",
      "I think one of the Committee persons asked, “How long would it take for\n",
      "certain things?”  We could tell you that in Irvington we have multiple projects\n",
      "on the drawing board, and we are ready to go on multiple ends.  We know --\n",
      "and most of land that we have in town we already own.  \n",
      "                  I could also tell you that we have met with the local governing\n",
      "body, the mayor and council.  We have had several subcommittees involved in\n",
      "the Board of Education, mayor, and council.  In fact, when I leave here today,\n",
      "we’re going to the planning board to submit to them recommendations for a\n",
      "site plan to put up a new middle school, which is part of our overall $173\n",
      "million school renovations suggestions.  \n",
      "                  So we feel we have accomplished quite a bit working with DOE\n",
      "and EDA, but the process has been cumbersome, and there’s still some quirks\n",
      "that have to be worked out.  But we are at a point in time now where we have\n",
      "to have a little bit more local input and local control on our destiny.  So far,\n",
      "EDA has determined that we’re first going to do roofs and now we’re going to\n",
      "do health and safety.  But because of time lapsing, many things now have to\n",
      "change.  The process has to be flexible so those changes can occur in a time\n",
      "frame that is conducive to our schools getting the remedies they need.\n",
      "                  Let me turn it over to Mr. Bloom, perhaps, who will be a little\n",
      "more specific.\n",
      "M I C H A E L   B L O O M:  And I’ll try to be brief.  I just want to make a\n",
      "baseline of where we started.  The first health and safety job in Irvington was\n",
      "new roofs.  And at the first conference meeting with them, I asked, “Well,\n",
      "what’s the insulation value that you’re going to put on the roofs?”  And we\n",
      "were told, “We’re not going to put insulation on the roof.”  At that point, I\n",
      "knew we were in trouble.  Things have been going on just about like that for\n",
      "two years.  \n",
      "                  I do have some positive suggestions without going through a bunch\n",
      "of terrible history.  Procedure is the problem.  There are two directions you can\n",
      "take.  Let the schools do the building.  They’ve been doing it for years.  Most\n",
      "of them are very experienced with it.  There are checks and balances within the\n",
      "system to create the proper project.  That would be the easy way out.  It might\n",
      "be, quite frankly, the most productive way out.  \n",
      "                  There are very good systems in place for other than Abbott\n",
      "districts.  Why should Abbott districts be that different?  Item two, if you’re\n",
      "going to be stuck in this quagmire of the EDA doing the work and the DOE\n",
      "doing the work--  Everybody is mentioning the EDA.  I’ve always looked at the\n",
      "EDA as sort of a constructive force and the DOE as the educational force.  As\n",
      "the regulations are today, the district has very, very little control.  The EDA\n",
      "hires the architects.  The EDA does all the preliminary predevelopment work. \n",
      "They say that the town has input or the school board has input, but, in fact,\n",
      "we find that it’s very minimal, and it is time consuming.  \n",
      "                  We’ve had a vocational school which has been under rent.  We’ve\n",
      "been renting it for an elementary school for several years and that has been\n",
      "approved on a long-range facility plan to purchase.  This was two years ago,\n",
      "guys.  Okay.  Nothing has been done.  We have not been told anything about\n",
      "any offers made to the county to purchase that building.  We sort of got our\n",
      "list, and Mike has referred to it, together as a proactive plan.  I met with Caren\n",
      "Franzini on some of these harder subjects.  We have five subjects.  She very\n",
      "properly answered each one and said they would be activated on.  So I am\n",
      "hoping that it’s August that the procurement of that will at least start.  \n",
      "                  To make you aware, the DOE has a list of 19 items or something\n",
      "that has to be checked off and done properly before you purchase a site.  The\n",
      "EDA wants to do that work.  I think this is the work that should be done in\n",
      "predevelopment.  It should be funded by the EDA, and the individual school\n",
      "districts can do that work.  They can do it a lot faster.  It takes a month to six\n",
      "weeks to get a engineer hired for a survey.  You can get three adequate\n",
      "proposals in a week from qualified people to do that and have them on the job\n",
      "giving us answers as to whether this particular site is appropriate or not,\n",
      "instead of this waiting.  \n",
      "                  The predevelopment stage should be handled by the districts as far\n",
      "as total planning.  An Abbott district is not like building one school.  It’s like\n",
      "renovating your entire house while you’re still living in it.  It’s a difficult task. \n",
      "It takes planning.  It takes movement.  Curricula has to be always addressed,\n",
      "where these kids are going to live while this is being done and what to do first. \n",
      "It requires an implementation plan -- a whole war plan on how the district\n",
      "should be built.  This has never been a part of the EDA task.  I’ve been asking\n",
      "for it for a long time.  We’ve been doing it in Irvington by ourselves, and I\n",
      "think it’s been working.  And Caren finally came around a couple of weeks ago\n",
      "and said, “I think you’re right.  Maybe we should have one guy.  Allow the\n",
      "district to hire one guy to handle this very complex problem.”  At that point,\n",
      "we can do a complete schematic drawing for the school and the ed spec.  Right\n",
      "now the EDA is doing the ed spec.  That’s ridiculous.  \n",
      "                  So, if the school puts in the ed spec to the DOE and the full\n",
      "schematic drawing and the DOE approves it, and they will approve it on the\n",
      "basis of educational requirements just like they approve every other school\n",
      "district in the state, then it’s just, “Grind it out, boys.”  You give it to the EDA\n",
      "and let them grind it out, and they don’t have to pay for schematic drawings. \n",
      "They can hire any architect they want as long as they follow those schematics. \n",
      "The government should be satisfied, the district should be satisfied, and that\n",
      "would be a win-win for everybody.  \n",
      "                  My emphasis is on procurement and predevelopment funding. \n",

      "V I C T O R   R.   D E M M I N G:  Hello.  Yes.  One of the concerns I have\n",
      "is that I believe, more often than not, folks here in Trenton underestimate the\n",
      "ability and the quality of people that you have in your Abbott districts.  You’ve\n",
      "heard both Mikes address a lot of the issues that Irvington and most of the\n",
      "other Abbott districts are faced with, so I’m not going to belabor the issue.\n",
      "                  My main concern is something that has been voiced earlier by\n",
      "Senator Rice, is the economics of this whole Abbott issue.  Economics in the\n",
      "sense that all of the decisions are being rendered by EDA.  Local control is\n",
      "completely out.  And the truth of the matter, folks, is that local vendors--  And\n",
      "when I say local vendors, I’m not strictly alluding to the vendors that are in\n",
      "Irvington.  I’m talking about vendors in the neighboring communities that have\n",
      "provided service for the Irvington Board of Education.  I’ve been left out of the\n",
      "loop.  \n",
      "                  It also creates frustration on our behalf because those vendors who\n",
      "already have put together all of the design work that the district needs in order\n",
      "to move forward is put to the side.  What’s happening in all of our urban\n",
      "districts, to include Irvington, is that we’re now sitting there, and we’re waiting\n",
      "for work to be done.  As a result, those health and safety issues -- and I think\n",
      "Mike Steele alluded to that -- are sitting there in abeyance.  What does that do\n",
      "for any urban district?  Well, first of all, there are insurance costs that we have\n",
      "to concern with because health and safety is not only for the children, but it’s\n",
      "also for the administration.  It makes folks having to come into the district to\n",
      "work feel very ill at ease.  When you look at our per pupil costs and you take\n",
      "into consideration all those factors of additional costs that we have had to pay\n",
      "out because of these health and safety issues, there has to be some concern.\n",
      "                  I would just like to sum it up by saying that I really believe that\n",
      "this Committee should recognize that the Abbott districts are indeed folks who\n",
      "are capable to perform a lot of the services that have to be done as well as\n",
      "making sure that we are able to proceed as expeditiously as possible to get\n",

      "example, had they started in late May, early June or as soon as the kids left in\n",
      "June, we could have perhaps gotten through with the summer.  Two of our\n",
      "schools are getting new laboratories throughout the buildings.  The laboratories\n",
      "are 70-some years old, the original fixtures, etc.  We obviously can’t do that\n",
      "while the kids are in school.  We discussed that with the architects and might\n",
      "possibly try to do it over the Christmas break, but that nine- and ten-day span\n",
      "might not be sufficient. \n",
      "                  So we’re now looking at the summer of 2003.  The kids leave in\n",

      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN STANLEY:  So then we have a senior class\n",
      "that’s not going to have the benefit of having that laboratory or those\n",
      "laboratories.  Now another group graduates without.  A lot of us have said\n",
      "throughout the course of this that this is somewhat criminal what we’re doing,\n",
      "but what we’re not doing for these children.  I just want to know, for instance,\n",
      "if tomorrow or Thursday we were able to get whatever you need to get in order\n",
      "to start some of these things going, could we complete that by September and\n",

      "If they’re not done, kids are ill-served, ill-equipped.  We have it in our brass,\n",
      "our power to get it done.  And just because the right hand doesn’t know what\n",
      "the left hand is doing -- it’s not getting done.  I mean, it’s absolutely insane.  \n",
      "                  MR. STEELE:  Well, the other items that will be started next\n",

      "the district has been corresponding with the EDA about a boiler in the high\n",

      "they cannot fix the heating system at the high school this year, which is\n",
      "something Mr. Steele alluded to they should have done two years ago, is\n",
      "because there’s asbestos.  Therefore, they have to wait until next summer in\n",

      "your comments.  \n",
      "                  Senator.\n",
      "                  SENATOR RICE:  Let me just make a comment first of all because\n",
      "I’m not sure, Mr. Chairman, that the person from your district is here, but I\n",
      "know there’s a contractor from your district that was approved to do work and\n",
      "told by EDA that it has to be completed by August 31 but can’t get permits. \n",
      "It has nothing to do.  The response from people in EDA, “Well, we’re going to\n",
      "have to look into that, and we may have to extend that.”  My response was,\n",
      "“Yes, but it’s going to cost you more money.”  \n",
      "                  My concern is that -- you take a city like Newark where in the\n",
      "district the State said it was mismanagement of funds.  They come in, they rip\n",
      "us off twofold, and they’ll replace it.  You get into a situation in school\n",
      "construction and the State said we want to make sure that we don’t go beyond\n",
      "costs or spend more money than necessary, but yet they enhance the course\n",
      "through delays.  I’m going to suggest that at least the Joint Committee -- and\n",
      "I think Melanie is here someplace or another -- make note that we want to\n",
      "bring in, after we deal with EDA and DOE, we need to talk to the Attorney\n",
      "General because I think everybody is losing sight that it’s the Attorney\n",
      "General.  We indicated, and rightfully so, that his concern was that there’s\n",
      "going to be major corruption possibilities with this kind of money and\n",
      "unscrupulous contractors who can’t do a job or want too much for it and needs\n",
      "checks and balances.  \n",
      "                  I believe part of the problem is is that there has to be too many\n",
      "approvals, whether they’re verbal sign-offs on some of this processing.  Now,\n",
      "coming from a security background and law enforcement, I really believe that\n",
      "reasonable people today could put enough checks and balances on protecting\n",
      "the process against “organized” family influence as indicated by the Attorney\n",
      "General and/or unscrupulous contractors without frustrating people.  I believe\n",
      "that Caren Franzini, from my perspective, and the people I’ve talked to as an\n",
      "individual is doing a good job.  Her problem is that her decision has to be made\n",
      "around other people and this whole process and the administration.  We’ve\n",
      "accepted and faced those realities and run interference on it.  \n",
      "                  By the same token when you look at the process over there, EDA\n",
      "did not want to do this initially.  The legislators said we were going to EDA,\n",
      "because EDA, if you recall, had a better track record on affirmative action than\n",
      "any other agency.  And then we came and measured the affirmative action\n",
      "aspect of this right now, because those are questions I’m going to be raising\n",
      "also tomorrow is tell me if you spent $23 million in Paterson -- I don’t care\n",
      "what it was for -- you tell me how the local people participated.  I want to\n",
      "reemphasize it was myself and a Senate Democratic caucus that said that there\n",
      "will not be a vote for this program of funding unless there’s local and minority\n",
      "participation of contractors, vendors, those who are trained, untrained,\n",
      "unskilled workers, etc., were feasible, which does not mean that a local\n",
      "contractor be -- that contractor minority or nonminority, who cannot do the\n",
      "job, cannot qualify to do certain things should be given the job.  That’s not\n",
      "what we’re saying.  \n",
      "                  So this whole process of tying us down with the State is not\n",
      "working.  I knew it would not work because the State could not even come into\n",
      "the city of Newark or Jersey City or Paterson and deal with a smaller problem,\n",
      "as far as I’m concerned.  So I just wanted to indicate that -- and I look at the\n",
      "comments that I got from DCM and I understand those kinds of things.  But\n",
      "I think what Assemblyman Stanley was alluding to--  And by the way, this is\n",
      "part of my district and Assemblyman Stanley.  If there are things right now\n",
      "that’s being bogged down -- and that from anyone here from a district -- that\n",
      "you know if you have to prove it tomorrow you can get it done in a timely\n",
      "fashion and in  terms of school, we need to know that right away in writing,\n",
      "because it may mean that not a hearing, but we may have to collectively,\n",
      "individually go to the administration and say, “Look, get this process moving. \n",
      "Make an exception here and get this thing moving,” because it is our kids.\n",
      "                  The final thing is that those of us who are elected have enough\n",
      "sense to know by now, and if you’re fortunate enough not to know, you’re\n",
      "going to learn very soon, that when Mike Steele cannot put a (indiscernible)\n",
      "in and the people expect it to go in, you know who’s blamed for that?  Get rid\n",
      "of the superintendent, get rid of the BA, get rid of the locally elected officials. \n",
      "In the meanwhile, they’re sitting there saying, “But it’s not our fault.” \n",
      "Residents don’t want to hear that.  They want to know that the process is\n",
      "moving smoothly.  They understand that there are dollars to make things\n",
      "happen for our children and for our school district, and that’s the problem.  So\n",
      "we give advice because of what’s taking place.\n",
      "                  This whole thing at the State, as far as I’m concerned, and I will\n",
      "tell the governor, and I will tell anybody else who wants to know, it’s not about\n",
      "the State doing it better.  There is no monopoly on brains at the State level\n",
      "when they bring in people.  It’s about relationships, family, and friendships. \n",
      "Now to me, fine, that’s the way America is.  I have no problem with that as\n",
      "long as they’re capable.  But the bottom line is, is that the locals are going to\n",
      "have relationships and people there working with over the years also and family\n",
      "and friendships.  So don’t try to isolate who’s doing the work under the guise\n",
      "that these people are better, because that’s not the case.  Someone needs to say\n",
      "it, so I’m saying it.  That’s why I’m glad we’re having this hearing because the\n",
      "administration inherited a lot of things, but I think this administration needs\n",
      "to remember what was said to them by the taxpayers and voters in these urban\n",
      "districts and these schools districts in general and what we committed to do. \n",
      "                  The time has come for us to keep some commitments.  The\n",
      "campaign is over, and there’s going to be some of us who are Democrats who\n",
      "are going to be just as vigilant with this administration as we were with the\n",
      "Republican administration, because it’s not about partisan.  It’s about these\n",
      "children now, and we’re frustrated.  So I just want to go on record with that\n",
      "and ask you--  The question really is not to be answered.  The question is, are\n",
      "there issues that’s not being addressed here?  And if they are, get them to us\n",
      "in writing.  Get them to me in writing right away so I can pull some people to\n",
      "the table.  \n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN DORIA:  And I think that that’s extremely\n",
      "important, and that’s true for anyone in this room.  If there are projects that\n",
      "you know can get accomplished before the opening of school and you find\n",
      "frustrations in the bureaucracy, if you can get it to us and the Committee, we\n",
      "will try to then deal with EDA or with the appropriate people in the\n",

      "                  MR. BLOOM:  Mr. Chairman, I think that’s a very good thing to\n",
      "say and act on, but there’s a procedure here that is broken, and I think we\n",
      "should keep our eye on that ball.  If we keep chasing little things that are\n",
      "broken, the overall picture won’t be fixed.  This is a huge project.  The\n",
      "procedure is not that complicated, the correct procedure.\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN DORIA:  I agree with you, but unfortunately\n",
      "we’re not going to be able to solve the procedural issues in it’s totality over the\n",

      "Okay.  And I’ll be parochial.  I represent Irvington.  We’re going to make those\n",
      "changes.  We’re talking about the stuff that’s long-term and immediate.  That\n",
      "has to be done regardless.  But I’m telling you right now that I’m going to be\n",
      "pretty damn mad and angry if I find out there are issues I can address where\n",
      "I need to at least try to address in any of these districts, that can be resolved\n",
      "before school opens.  That’s for the record. \n",
      "                  So I understand what you’re saying.  We understand you.  I didn’t\n",
      "say that we’re forced to play games like the past with other folks to ignore and\n",
      "keep putting consultants on the other crap.  The other stuff is where our\n",

      "of reiterate what I said and Senator Rice kind of went on about afterwards, but\n",
      "that’s right.  We’ve got to work together to make sure that the things that can\n",

      "the size of this room right now.  Also, most of playground space is taken up by\n",
      "temporary classroom units, also known as TCUs, and parking space.  \n",
      "                  From the school district’s point of view and the community’s point\n",
      "of view, Block 1968 is the only possible site for a school in the area.  I hope\n",
      "you can find it in your hearts to assure that this land is set aside for the First\n",

      "                  Thank you.\n",
      "                  MS. JELLY:  We need to know the timeline for this school as well\n",
      "as the others in Phase I, the 20 schools in Newark.  The timeline is essential\n",
      "because the community organizations, the parents, and the other community\n",
      "representatives need to work with the school district representatives,\n",
      "particularly the local principals and representatives of the professional staff to\n",
      "investigate the interest and the nature of community schools.  This has already\n",
      "been mentioned about by Mr. Sciarra.  \n",
      "                  In the neighborhoods of the six schools in our area of North\n",
      "Newark, there are a number of critical needs that community schools could\n",
      "satisfy.  The universal denominator is the need for open space and recreational\n",
      "facilities.  This is really wanting in the north part of Newark.  Community\n",
      "schools can be an effective input with parental community input, and we do\n",
      "need this.  \n",
      "                  So I think that we ask you at this particular point in your talks\n",
      "tomorrow with the Economic Development Authority and as well as the local\n",
      "school district to see what the time line is to implement Phase I of the School\n",
      "Facilities plan.  We ask you to focus on this in a particular way.  So, that again,\n",
      "we will do our part in assuring that there is community and parental\n",
      "involvement, but we need your participation in this as well.\n",
      "                  We thank you for this time.  Any questions or comments?\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN DORIA:  Thank you. \n",
      "                  Any questions?  \n",
      "                  We want to thank you, young man, for your presentation.  You did\n",

      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN DIEGNAN:  I just want to get a sense of this. \n",
      "How long ago was this lot identified or this parcel?\n",
      "                  MS. ANTUNES:  About two years ago.\n",
      "                  MS. JELLY:  Well, it was right in the beginning it was identified. \n",
      "It was one of the few places -- few schools that--  It was the only lot that was\n",
      "available.\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN DIEGNAN:  And there has been a general\n",
      "consensus that this is an appropriate parcel to build upon?\n",
      "                  MS. JELLY:  That’s correct.\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN DIEGNAN:  And from that point to the\n",
      "present, nothing has happened?  Has due diligence taken place?  By that, I\n",
      "mean has there been environmental studies, surveying, anything of that\n",
      "nature?\n",
      "                  MS. ANTUNES:  There was supposed to be.  They promised us\n",
      "by the end of August there would be all that done, and they would acquire the\n",
      "land and everything.  So far, nothing has been done.\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN DIEGNAN:  So, to your knowledge, have\n",
      "professionals even been retained to do appraisals on the property?  Has\n",
      "anything taken place?\n",
      "                  MS. ANTUNES:  Not that I know of.  They were supposed to-- \n",
      "Everything was supposed to be--\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN DIEGNAN:  Is that just your supposition, or are\n",
      "you pretty certain that nothing has been done to date?\n",
      "                  MS. ANTUNES:  I’m not really sure, but from what I heard,\n",
      "nothing has been done.\n",
      "                  MS. JELLY:  See, the difficulty with this is that the land had been\n",
      "sold by a private developer to another housing development.  All of the\n",
      "investigation was in the process of being done for that when both the school\n",
      "district and the city realized that this land was precious for the school.  But to\n",
      "my knowledge, that it is still in the hands of the private developer.\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN DORIA:  May I ask a question?  Eminent\n",
      "domain has not been exercised by the school district or the city?\n",
      "                  MS. JELLY:  No.  It has not.  \n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN DORIA:  So the property is still held by the\n",
      "private developer, and because of that then the due diligence wouldn’t have\n",
      "taken place if it’s still owned by the private developers.  \n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN DIEGNAN:  It’s crazy.  Okay.\n",
      "                  Thank you.  Thank you very much.\n",
      "                  MR. ANTUNES:  Thank you.\n",

      "located?\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN DORIA:  By First Avenue School, right?\n",
      "                  MS. ANTUNES:  That’s correct.  It’s called Block 1968.\n",

      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN DORIA:  Block 1968.  And what street is it?\n",
      "                  MR. ANTUNES:  Between First Avenue, Second Avenue and--\n",

      "opportunity to testify on the problems and issues associated with the\n",
      "implementation of the Educational Facilities Construction and Financing Act. \n",
      "My name is Karla Spivey, and I am the Executive Director of The Coalition for\n",
      "Our Children’s Schools.  \n",
      "                  I would like to briefly give you a background on my organization’s\n",
      "missions and accomplishments.  The Coalition for Our Children’s Schools was\n",
      "convened in early 2000 to address the public debate surrounding the Abbott\n",
      "school construction program.  It’s mission then and now is to coordinate the\n",
      "advocacy capabilities of civic, educational, governmental, children’s and\n",
      "business organizations to make sure that the State of New Jersey responds\n",
      "efficiently and effectively to an obligation to provide not only safe and\n",
      "adequate, but outstanding educational facilities under the mandate of New\n",
      "Jersey Supreme Court’s Abbott v. Burke decision.  \n",
      "                  Currently, the coalition’s members boast of over 90 organizations\n",
      "throughout New Jersey.  And I can say, some of our esteemed organizations are\n",
      "here and have testified today.  Our organizations, who are members, are the\n",
      "Education Law Center, Hispanic Directors of New Jersey, the Paterson\n",
      "Coalition for Our Children’s Schools, the New Jersey Institute for Social\n",
      "Justice, and other groups and individuals, like I said, throughout the state.  \n",
      "                  Our members subscribe to five guiding principles, and they’re\n",
      "included in your package.  We feel that schools should be flexible to meet and\n",
      "accommodate changes in enrollments and technologies.  We feel, secondly,\n",
      "that school should be designed and built to strengthen neighborhoods and\n",
      "communities.  Thirdly, we think that the Abbott schools construction program\n",
      "should provide the greatest possible training, employment, and subcontracting\n",
      "opportunities for businesses and individuals in the Abbott school districts. \n",
      "Fourth, we think that the planning design of the Abbotts schools should\n",
      "include all stakeholders in the local neighborhoods.  And fifth, we think that\n",
      "the Abbott school construction should be paid for with new State funds.  \n",
      "                  Now I should underscore that our work is solely centered in the 30\n",
      "Abbott districts.  Since our inception, we’ve held forums throughout the 30\n",
      "districts.  We’ve published user-friendly assessment of the act.  We’ve\n",
      "published various issue briefs.  We’ve had press conferences, and we’ve done\n",
      "a wide variety of work throughout the 30 Abbott districts.  We’ve worked with\n",
      "the Vice-Chair, Assemblyman Stanley, to host a forum in his school district of\n",
      "Irvington.  Chairman Doria, as previously stated, the purpose of these hearings\n",
      "is to outline the current problems to implementation of the School\n",
      "Construction Act.  \n",
      "                  I should start by saying that this month signals a critical time. We \n",
      "have just marked the second anniversary of the enactment of the law, and the\n",
      "coalition remains cautiously optimistic and looks forward to working with the\n",
      "McGreevey administration and Legislature to get quality school facilities built\n",
      "in the 30 Abbott districts.  But as mentioned by David Sciarra at the Law\n",
      "Center, we are distressed at the lack of progress thus far.  Over the past two\n",
      "years, not a single, not one school has been constructed in the Abbotts, and out\n",
      "of an estimated $600 million of health and safety projects, only about 27\n",
      "percent of those jobs have been awarded.\n",
      "                  The coalition recognizes Governor McGreevey’s strongly voiced\n",
      "commitment to better education for public school students throughout the\n",
      "state and to implementing the Abbott remedies in particular.  We applaud his\n",
      "most recent executive order establishing the schools corporation, and we\n",
      "welcome his appointment of Alfred McNeill as CEO.  We do believe that\n",
      "streamlining the process is a good first step, but these administrative\n",
      "rearrangements cannot ensure that the State of New Jersey respond efficiently\n",
      "and effectively to an obligation to provide not only safe and adequate, but\n",
      "outstanding educational facilities under the mandate of the State’s Supreme\n",
      "Court Abbott decision.\n",
      "                  The coalition believes that the McGreevey administration is\n",
      "sympathetic to our goals of building schools that serve as neighborhood\n",
      "anchors.  We hear what the governor says, as he did yesterday, that this\n",
      "administration is committed to streamlining the process.  It is truly\n",
      "cumbersome and inefficient and the flaws are embedded in the statute as it is\n",
      "passed.  The results are serious delays in implementation.  We believe that the\n",
      "McGreevey administration understand the importance of including parents and\n",
      "stakeholders of the planning and design of their neighborhood schools.  We\n",
      "believe that this administration--\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN DORIA:  Karla, I just want to--  I would ask\n",
      "because we have the time frame--\n",
      "                  MS. SPIVEY:  Time.  Okay.\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN DORIA:  If you could just basically summarize\n",
      "it, because we have the statement here.  Just summarize.  We all appreciate the\n",
      "McGreevey administration, but we don’t need to overdo it.\n",
      "                  MS. SPIVEY:  What I’ll do is I’ll put -- okay.  Well, what I want\n",
      "to do is say that I think, and it’s included in the back of your packages, that\n",
      "what we’re saying is that administrative remedies are not going to solve the\n",
      "problem.  We look to this Committee to look at keeping the door open to\n",
      "amend the legislation, and we have in our work analyzed the legislation and\n",
      "have divided into five parts.  I said it’s included in your packages.\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN DORIA:  That would be important, so why\n",
      "don’t you tell us the five amendments you suggested, yes.\n",
      "                  MS. SPIVEY:  Okay, five.  The first one is we think there is an\n",
      "amendment to facilitate the construction of community schools, multiple use,\n",
      "and mixed use of schools.  Secondly, we have amendments to improve the\n",
      "efficiency and flexibility of the school planning design and construction\n",
      "program.  Third, amendments to improve the community planning and\n",
      "resident participation in the school construction program.  Fourth, our\n",
      "amendments to address early education needs, and fifth, amendments to\n",
      "address local work force development and contracting.\n",
      "                  In the area of amendments to facilitate the construction of\n",
      "community schools, multiple use, and mixed use schools, I just included in the\n",
      "testimony that there are three areas that you could look to, but there are many\n",
      "more.  One is to provide, where feasible and educationally appropriate -- school\n",
      "projects should be designed for suitable use including facilities both inside and\n",
      "outside the school structures for multiple and community use, that school\n",
      "projects should incorporate and be integrated with complimentary facilities\n",
      "such as public recreational facilities, health-care clinics, and early childhood\n",
      "facilities operated by community providers.  That instead of there being a\n",
      "designation for demonstration projects, all school projects eligible for funding\n",
      "under the act should be given the opportunity to include community designed\n",
      "features and their eligible cost and that the provision for demonstration\n",
      "projects should be repealed.  Thirdly, you should authorize districts to submit\n",
      "projects for approval containing blended revenue sources included but not\n",
      "limited to public funds, federal, state, corporate, and foundation grants.  \n",
      "                  The second area of amendments is to improve the efficiency and\n",
      "flexibility of school planning, design, and construction process authorizing the\n",
      "department to delegate the responsible to plan, design, and construct the\n",
      "school districts that submit construction management programs where the\n",
      "commissioners by the district and its construction partners have the capability\n",
      "to carrying out the program and to have submitted a realistic plan for carrying\n",
      "it out in a timely fashion and provide, like Mr. Bloom said, provide flexibility\n",
      "and efficiency for site acquisition predevelopment costs relating to the site\n",
      "acquisition and utilization of school projects.  \n",
      "                  Thirdly is -- and I’m not going to get into it, because we have time\n",
      "is of the essence -- is that community participation and resident participation\n",
      "is very key in this process.  We have a lot of districts and a lot of -- our\n",
      "community is saying we want to participate in the process but how are those\n",
      "costs going to be reimbursed back to the district?  So we’re saying that\n",
      "participatory community school planning should be appropriate\n",
      "predevelopment cost.  It should be part of the predevelopment cost, as a\n",
      "reimbursable item, and that EDA should provide clear language to the school\n",
      "districts and have the municipalities and school districts work together to\n",
      "conduct community out reach and seek community input in all stages, such as\n",
      "site acquisition, design, and planning.  \n",
      "                  Thirdly, a reporting should be made to the public from DOE, EDA,\n",
      "and the new school corporation, and it should be done on an Abbott, on a\n",
      "district by district basis and also identify school by school.  Four is there are\n",
      "amendments in your packages to address the early childhood education needs. \n",
      "And as the Law Center has testified this morning, is that the DOE should\n",
      "adopt facility standards for early educational facilities.  Also, the DOE should\n",
      "conduct assessments in each one of the districts of all the early childhood\n",
      "providers in that district, and that should include community providers and\n",
      "Head Start programs.  \n",
      "                  And lastly, there should be -- we have amendments for work force\n",
      "development opportunities, and there should be an inclusion of affirmative\n",
      "action and local hiring and subcontracting plan as part of the contractor\n",
      "selection process.  Also, data should be collected on that process and report it\n",
      "back out to the community.  There should be mandating, the inclusion of\n",
      "apprentices on these Abbott projects.  \n",
      "                  So, with that, I again thank you for this opportunity to give\n",
      "testimony and look to work with the administration and the Legislature to\n",
      "make these, the Abbott schools, a reality.  Like I said, the amendments in the\n",
      "school text are included in your packages.\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN DORIA:  Thank you.  Thank you very much.\n",
      "                  Next Joyce Harley, Executive Director of the New Jersey\n",

      "We’re absolutely committed to the Abbott decision and the school construction\n",
      "legislation, particularly as it applies to preschool facilities.  \n",
      "                  We are extremely concerned that absolutely nothing has been done\n",
      "in the two years since this law was enacted.  Assemblyman Malone, you talked\n",
      "a little bit about disappointment.  Well, it’s more than disappointing, it’s\n",
      "disgraceful that this has been allowed to occur.  You talked a little bit about\n",
      "criminal.  Well, it’s absolutely criminal because there has been a very\n",
      "broad-based contempt for the Supreme Court’s decision that said every single\n",
      "three- and four-year-old in the Abbott districts should have access to\n",
      "high-quality preschool education.  The legislation certainly included the\n",
      "community providers that we fund.  \n",
      "                  Our own Department of Education which has shown and\n",
      "demonstrated by both word and deed that it is unable to fully implement the\n",
      "legislation that was enacted -- our own Department of Education has predicted\n",
      "that there will be an increase of over 10,000 preschoolers in the Abbott\n",
      "preschool programs in the year 2002-2003 school year.  Total Abbott preschool\n",
      "enrollment will rise from nearly 30,000 to nearly 40,000 with an increase in\n",
      "every single district. It is our contention that not only has there been a\n",
      "misunderstanding of what their roles and responsibilities are with respect to\n",
      "the legislation and with respect to these children, but there has been a lack of\n",
      "will, both of the Department of Education and the Economic Development\n",
      "Authority to see this law fully enacted and fully implemented.  \n",
      "                  You’ve heard testimony from mayors, from superintendents, from\n",
      "school district personnel, from Legislators, and from each other that this is not\n",
      "just an education reform opportunity.  It’s an economic development\n",
      "opportunity.  In the districts that we serve, the 14 districts for LISC brings\n",
      "financial and technical assistance and support.  You couple the Abbott decision\n",
      "with welfare reform and you recognize the very people whose jobs depend on\n",
      "their ability to work and the very economic revitalization which their cities\n",
      "depend on having these people work is hampered by the fact that there is no\n",
      "high-quality preschool education for three- and four-year-olds.  And that really\n",
      "is what’s criminal about it.  Because remember, you’re only three once.  You’re\n",
      "only four once.  From our vantage point, preschool construction is kind of like\n",
      "justice.  In order to be effective, it’s got to be both swift and certain, and that\n",
      "has not happened here.  \n",
      "                  And as we looked at the legislation as it was initially being enacted,\n",
      "everybody hailed New Jersey for its foresight and for its commitment to its\n",
      "children.  We said our Supreme Court were New Jersey children’s best friends\n",
      "and yet we run the risk--  And I’m so glad Assemblyman Doria that you called\n",
      "these hearings.  We run the risk of being the laughing stock of the nation for\n",
      "having squandered this important opportunity because there is empirical data\n",
      "that everybody agrees with that says if you educate and start with your three-\n",

      "J A M E S   N I C H O L S:  Good afternoon, members of the Committee.  I\n",
      "should start by saying I’m really here in my capacity as a private consultant,\n",
      "and I’m really limiting my remarks to a specific issue that has become apparent\n",
      "actually since the time I’ve left the Department of Education that I thought it\n",
      "would be of value to the Committee in the context of the topic of its hearings,\n",
      "and that is the need for districtwide technology planning as part of the school\n",
      "construction initiative.  \n",
      "                  The need for districtwide technology planning, as an eligible cost\n",
      "for one or more school facilities projects, has been extremely apparent in the\n",
      "first two years of implementing EFCFA.  Although many school districts have\n",
      "made significant progress installing computer technology in the classroom,\n",
      "providing Internet connectivity, teacher training, and other ingredients for\n",
      "successful technology-based learning -- much of it subsidized by State and\n",
      "federal funds -- these efforts have not been coordinated with the scope of\n",
      "building construction that is getting underway as a result of EFCFA.\n",
      "                  And the reason for that is based on a strict interpretation of the\n",
      "language and the statute the Department of Education has been unwilling to\n",
      "authorize the professional services required to perform districtwide needs\n",
      "assessments for technology and to set districtwide standards for voice, video,\n",
      "and data, because the scope of such services encompasses more than one school\n",
      "facility and thus does not meet the strict definition of a school facilities project\n",
      "in the eye of the Department of Education.\n",
      "                  While some non-Abbott districts may have the resources to initiate\n",
      "and fund such studies, other districts do not.  In particular, Abbott district’s\n",
      "requests for such funds in their annual budgets have often been reallocated to\n",
      "other purposes during the budget review process.  And as a result, the benefits\n",
      "that would arise from districtwide coordination of the technology components\n",
      "of individual school facilities projects, including efficient utilization of\n",
      "instructional resources districtwide, ease of maintenance and repair,\n",
      "intra-district connectivity become difficult if not impossible to achieve.  In\n",
      "addition, the possibility for coordination of educational computing systems,\n",
      "district management systems, and smart building technologies for security and\n",
      "energy efficiency may be neglected.\n",
      "                  By making districtwide technology studies eligible costs pursuant\n",
      "to EFCFA or by authorizing the expenditure of funds directly by the EDA\n",
      "under the broad authority granted to it under the statute, enormous\n",
      "educational benefits will be realized by students and cost savings will be\n",
      "realized by State and local taxpayers.  \n",
      "                  Thank you.\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN DORIA:  Thank you.\n",
      "                  I think you bring a very important issue to the forefront, the need\n",
      "to tie in the technology development as part of the construction process.  It’s\n",
      "an important point.\n",
      "                  Anyone have any questions?\n",
      "                  Yes, Senator Rice.\n",
      "                  SENATOR RICE:  Let me concur because if its not really put in\n",
      "during the time of school construction, it’s going to be more costly.  But my\n",
      "question is really to Assemblyman Malone, he may know.  Under the act, was\n",
      "that interpretation, was that eliminated intentionally or do you know why the\n",
      "interpretation of--\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN MALONE:  No, I don’t.  About the technology\n",
      "inclusion?\n",
      "                  SENATOR RICE:  Yes.\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN MALONE:  I think it was probably one of the\n",
      "lower levels within the--  I think it was reduced as one of the lower levels in the\n",
      "piece of legislation.  I would concur that this is a critical aspect.  We do a lot\n",
      "of it where I am, and we actually go back and have had to retrofit our buildings\n",
      "to make sure that they were all both fiber wired and hard wired with\n",
      "conventional wiring.  \n",
      "                  As has been mentioned, I would be very much interested in\n",
      "participating in some amendment process in this piece of legislation as we\n",
      "move forward, and I think I said that on the floor during the debate.  I thought\n",
      "that there would need to be amendments made to this legislation as we moved\n",
      "forward because it was such a massive undertaking that I think that we’re\n",
      "starting to see some of the warts and some of the unpleasant aspects of\n",
      "something so big and massive as this piece of legislation.  \n",
      "                  I was very impressed by this young lady’s very, very strong concern\n",
      "about moving forward on this legislation.  So, if there’s something I can do,\n",
      "through you, Mr. Chairman, or anyone else, in helping support amending\n",
      "certain aspects of this legislation that may be necessary, I would be more than\n",
      "willing to participate in that process.\n",
      "                  SENATOR RICE:  Mr. Chairman?\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN DORIA:  Senator.\n",
      "                  SENATOR RICE:  Yes.  Through you, Mr. Chairman, and to you,\n",
      "because you also chair the Assembly Education Committee, you indicated\n",
      "before that--  I kind of tacitly, to some degree, concur that they need not do\n",
      "“amendments” until we try to figure out where we are going.  But I said tacitly\n",
      "to some reasonable degree, I think that it constitutes some interpretation or\n",
      "definitions.  We may have to do some amendments because the worse thing\n",
      "that could happen is whether they’re going to retrofit perspective on ways\n",
      "addressing bringing schools up to date on new construction that the resources\n",
      "are not really there to deal with technology, and the school district will have\n",
      "to find another resource to make that happen, or the Department say, “Well,\n",
      "if you don’t install the technology or do the things you have to do to make it\n",
      "work in the 21st Century, we’re not going to approve your planning projects.” \n",
      "It’s almost like a contradiction to say build a new school or retrofit or bring a\n",
      "new school up to where it should be in our time.  We have all this money for\n",
      "you to do that but we’re not giving you money to do the piece that’s going to\n",
      "make the difference in the district buying all this stuff that they’re talking\n",
      "about.  \n",
      "                  So, I wanted to raise that because if, in fact, on the Assembly side,\n",
      "the Assembly members are willing to sponsor any amended legislation to deal\n",
      "with technology and definitions I’m certainly willing to sponsor it.  I’m certain\n",
      "-- I can’t speak for them -- but I’m sure that Senator Baer and others would\n",
      "sponsor it in the Senate side.  But this we really need to look at.  This is going\n",
      "to hurt all of us if it’s not addressed.\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN DORIA:  I agree with you, Senator.  And\n",
      "obviously, as a result of these hearings, if we see any pressing issues that need\n",
      "to be taken on, I think we will.  I agree with you, because this is something that\n",
      "I was not really fully aware of.  I didn’t realize it had been pushed down that\n",
      "far in the priority listing in the Construction Act.  \n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN MALONE:  I think it bumped down to the\n",
      "fourth, I think.\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN DORIA:  So it’s fourth, Assemblyman Malone\n",
      "says.  But again, we need at the end of these two days of hearings to sit down\n",
      "and maybe spend a little time reviewing what may necessarily be an immediate\n",
      "set of amendments that may have to be done.  Again, we want to make sure\n",
      "that we can get the implementation of the building program as effectively as\n",
      "possible and as quickly as possible.\n",
      "                  Thank you.\n",

      "Paterson Education Fund.\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN MALONE:  Just while we’re waiting, Mr.\n",
      "Chairman, I think that before we move forward on the technology, we may\n",
      "want to get in some technology experts because of the potential of going\n",
      "wireless with some of these computer integrated aspects that we may not have\n",
      "to hardwire schools in the relatively near future.  So for us to maybe go ahead\n",
      "and spend that kind of money to hardwire schools, it may not be necessary\n",
      "three to four years from now.\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN DORIA:  I think the issue becomes -- the\n",
      "various elements.  The Internet you don’t have to wire.  There’s some other\n",
      "things you might have to wire.  Part of the wiring process is obviously the\n",
      "Internet.  Part of the other part of the wiring process is the internal system so\n",
      "that, I think you’re right.  We need some technology people to talk about this.\n",
      "                  Councilman Jones.\n",
      "C O U N C I L M A N   J E F F E R Y   J O N E S:  Thank you for allowing\n",
      "me to come and present, in terms of the testimony, regarding the construction\n",
      "implementation concerns regarding Abbott schools, and particularly to the city\n",
      "of Paterson.  I also, in the capacity of the Paterson Education Fund in Paterson\n",
      "-- has been a 19-year organization with experience in advocacy around\n",
      "educational issues in Paterson and has become a member of the coalition.  \n",
      "                  My concerns to be presented are based on Paterson communities\n",
      "involvement and concerns into this process, or lack of the communication and\n",
      "involvement of the community in the design and planning phases and the\n",
      "inclusion of certain community amenities either by legislation or regulation. \n",
      "What was just recently stated by Senator Rice lends itself that, perhaps, there\n",
      "needs to be some new considerations with respect to amendments that allow\n",
      "for certain amenities to be added.  \n",
      "                  I’ll start by saying that I led the charge at the Paterson Education\n",
      "Fund in hosting six community forums.  Those forums were to give the\n",
      "community an opportunity to talk about what was pending with respect to\n",
      "school construction.  What we found was that most of the information that we\n",
      "felt residents should have had was never made available.  For the record, I’ve\n",
      "also brought for each of you a copy of the six individual ward reports.  On the\n",
      "back page, you’ll find, and at your leisure -- and I believe she’ll be handing\n",
      "those out to you shortly -- you’ll find what we took from the Paterson Public\n",
      "Schools report expectations of the various schools and what was going to\n",
      "happen to them.\n",
      "                  A community that’s waiting and has been waiting for new school\n",
      "construction to occur to get copies of this report, only to find out that it gave\n",
      "little or no detail, is quite alarming and creates a great deal of concern,\n",
      "particularly when you start hearing things like swing space and things like this,\n",
      "things that our folks are just putting on the table with no definitional detail. \n",
      "So we have made it our goal, our priority, to go out and make sure that folks\n",
      "are aware of all those details, all those descriptions, all those definitions, all the\n",
      "places that we felt they needed to go in order to understand the impact of\n",
      "school construction.  \n",
      "                  One of the things that just kept resonating time and time again\n",
      "was even in doing so this dual communication both from the district and the\n",
      "EDA just was not there, has not been there.  It’s been very difficult to hear and\n",
      "pin down exactly what to expect, when to find out what’s going to occur, and\n",
      "so forth and so on.  We feel that without this communication, without the\n",
      "community being actively involved at the time of design only through planning\n",
      "that it will probably not reflect -- those new schools will not reflect those needs\n",
      "and those concerns the way the community are expecting and would like to\n",
      "have.\n",
      "                  We don’t know if, in fact, or how we can ensure that this happens. \n",
      "And again, that’s one of the reasons that we’re here to make sure that this is\n",
      "presented that it is a concern.  I’m certain, and though I can’t speak for every\n",
      "other community that’s an Abbott district, but I’m certain that is their concern\n",
      "as well, that they have the opportunity to have their voices heard, their\n",
      "considerations met, and perhaps much more open dialogue.\n",
      "                  Another item was and is, in fact, one of the vehicles that exist in\n",
      "the EDA that’s used to keep the community abreast and informed of the\n",
      "various issues.  In most cases, it was either inaccessible or was outdated in\n",
      "terms of the information, which again does not allow for a community that’s\n",
      "interested in being active participants, is the ability to follow along.  So we\n",
      "would ask that any changes, particularly those that have been announced by\n",
      "the governor yesterday with this new construction program, that\n",
      "communication be one of the first considerations of ongoing, regular scheduled\n",
      "opportunities to engage the community so that there would be crossed-off and\n",
      "open dialogue. \n",
      "                  I’ll sum up and move to my last point which is particularly of great\n",
      "interest to those of us in Paterson, and that is that (a), as we’re an Abbott\n",
      "district, we’re the third largest city in the State of New Jersey.  We’re also a\n",
      "distressed city.  One of the problems we’re having is we have one single solitary\n",
      "swimming pool.  And while that may not be an issue, it becomes an issue if you\n",
      "take a look at many other communities who are facing many of the same\n",
      "problems -- the asbestos, the health concerns, the lack of green spaces and\n",
      "such.  So when we start talking about building new schools, particularly\n",
      "community-type schools, as opposed to schooling, having those kinds of\n",
      "amenities, that in particular being pools, becomes critical for the life-blood, for\n",
      "the future generations, for the communities themselves.  \n",
      "                  So we’d ask that you would consider this particularly as for pools\n",
      "to be included in or added to this process would require some amendment to\n",
      "the legislation.  Again, that’s to the point that Senator Rice made, and it’s\n",
      "definitely something that we would hope that you would consider.  It was also\n",
      "presented to us that in Jersey City, who was very successful as being creative,\n",
      "both prior to this process, but had the benefit of placing 12 new pools in their\n",
      "community.  What that has done has allowed the community, particularly its\n",
      "kids and its neighbors, to receive those benefits as the non-Abbott districts and\n",
      "non-Abbott communities have -- full recreational advantages, and an\n",
      "opportunity for good clean health and a few of the other issues that make up\n",
      "this quality of life that we all see.  \n",
      "                  I thank you for allowing me to come and speak to you.  I am\n",
      "certain that I will be back time and time again.  The city of Paterson does, in\n",
      "fact, need as much help and support as we can, particularly around our schools. \n",
      "We feel that once our schools are on the road to recovery that our community,\n",
      "our homes, will just be a step away.  \n",
      "                  So I thank you very much, and if there are any questions.\n",

      "moving.  We’ve also had some concerns but have been pretty supportive of the\n",
      "EDA and their methods.  It’s taken a long time.  It’s a very big project, a very\n",

      "a big deal.  We think that’s significant.\n",
      "                  From the construction industry standpoint, sort of our biggest\n",
      "concern in this whole process is not only getting the work out on to the street\n",
      "but ensuring that good quality contractors are able to bid the work and are able\n",
      "to get the work.  Because when you have good quality contractors bidding\n",
      "these projects and building these projects, you get local residents involved.  You\n",
      "get health and safety concerns answered.  You have good safe work sites. \n",
      "Prevailing wages are paid to the workers, so you’re not fighting to make sure\n",
      "that the contractor is paying the right wage rate.  Overall, you get a much\n",

      "                  We worked very hard with Assemblyman Malone in the drafting\n",
      "of this legislation to ensure that the bidding -- that the way the bidding would\n",
      "be done would ensure those quality contractors.  We’ve been reasonably happy\n",

      "the Legislature in ensuring that as they move forward now with a new\n",

      "the Department of Education, and then we had to talk to somebody in EDA,\n",
      "and then there were a couple of people to talk to at EDA.  It got to be a process\n",

      "districts, there’s been no construction in Paterson.  So I won’t elaborate any\n",
      "further on that, but to say that’s certainly something that is not evident in\n",

      "                  (indiscernible) like the governor’s announcement yesterday to form\n",
      "the new school corporation and to streamline the health and safety\n",

      "newly formed corporation must be closely monitored to ensure the fulfillment\n",
      "of its highly touted promises.  The other reason and the reason I really want\n",
      "to speak to today why it was fitting for the announcement to be made in\n",
      "Paterson was because of the emphasis that Governor McGreevey made in\n",
      "community participation in the school construction initiative, particularly in\n",
      "districts like Paterson.  Not only is such a concept inherent in the third and\n",

      "constructed, and renovated.  \n",
      "                  Councilman Jones elaborated at a little bit earlier about the\n",

      "in real conversations about our needs and our concerns and how they relate to\n",
      "the schools that are going to be built.  It simply makes sense to involve the\n",
      "community in the process relating to school construction, whether it be in\n",
      "providing input as to site acquisition, school and community design elements,\n",
      "or neighborhood economic development and local hiring plans and practices. \n",

      "Everyone from Legislators to executive branch officials to local school\n",
      "administrators should support the governor’s initiative in this regard and strive\n",
      "to promote the general importance of community participation so that\n",

      "                  We agree with David Sciarra, as his earlier recommendations, that\n",
      "clear policies be embedded in the construction program through regulations\n",
      "that require community participation in design and planning of the schools. \n",
      "One practical way to promote such measures is to require the new schools\n",
      "corporation, and in particular local school districts, to extend themselves\n",
      "through meaningful public forums.  Through such forums, strategies for\n",
      "effective and efficient community involvement and planning can also be\n",
      "developed.  In this way, we also support making community school planning\n",
      "an appropriate predevelopment funding cost under the legislation to be used\n",
      "by the Economic Development Authority, the new schools corporation, and the\n",
      "local school districts to engage the local community in planning meetings early\n",
      "on in the process.  \n",
      "                  Another way is through development of systems and reporting\n",
      "mechanisms designed to make pertinent information available to the public. \n",
      "Until now, it has been next to impossible for community organizations and\n",
      "citizens such as the ones we’re working with in Paterson to obtain critical\n",

      "construction projects, their descriptions, and where they are situated on the\n",
      "construction time line, and so forth and so forth.\n",
      "                  The consequence is that a well-intentioned community often feels\n",
      "left in the dark, and frustration can then lead to antagonism.  However, if\n",
      "everyone begins to see and understand the value of community involvement at\n",
      "every step of the school construction process, and if these types of practical\n",

      "example, by requiring the new schools corporation and local school districts to\n",
      "make certain pertinent information available on Websites and/or through\n",

      "I’m the retired Superintendent of Schools from one of the Abbott districts, and\n",
      "I currently work as a consultant for urban affairs for the New Jersey\n",
      "Association of School Administrators.  In that capacity, I work with the urban\n",
      "superintendents around the state, not just Abbotts, but all urban districts.  \n",
      "                  Rather than read through this statement to you, there are several\n",
      "points that I’d just like to emphasize.  Virtually all of the points I wanted to\n",
      "make to you have been made by others this morning.  So I’ll just skip through\n",
      "and emphasize a few.  \n",
      "                  The health and safety projects, of course, has been a real\n",
      "frustration to the people that I work with.  You must remember that the\n",
      "Department of Education started announcing, and at times with grand fanfare,\n",
      "in October of 1998 the list of projects that were approved.  In order for the\n",
      "Department to approve those projects in October of ’98, they had to have been\n",
      "planned for and submitted to the Department prior to that.  So you have a\n",
      "situation where you heard some of our urban superintendents this morning talk\n",
      "about situations where projects were of an emergent nature prior to 1998 and\n",
      "still have not been completed. \n",
      "                  I don’t know whether Dr. Clausell mentioned to you earlier this\n",
      "morning that they are not running summer school in some of their buildings\n",
      "this summer in order to attend to some of those emergency projects and then\n",
      "he was informed in the end of June that they’re not going to get to them this\n",
      "summer as well.  At New Brunswick last year, the same thing happened where\n",
      "the summer school was canceled because they went out to bid to do emergency\n",
      "projects and then they, for one reason or another, were not accommodated.  \n",
      "                  So, ironically, you have a situation where emergency projects\n",
      "enumerated prior to 1998 have not been completed as of this date.  I’m happy\n",
      "to say that in looking at the new data that a good number of them are in the\n",
      "works now, yet they’re not going to be completed prior to the beginning of\n",
      "school this September.  \n",
      "                  A second point that I want to mention is the acquisition of\n",
      "property.  Happily, in some of our urban areas, the financial picture is\n",
      "improving, which means then that the value of property is increasing, which\n",
      "means then that it’s also then more difficult to obtain and more costly to\n",
      "obtain.  And throughout this lengthy process -- you’ve heard testimony earlier\n",

      "program in the State’s history, offers to produce both 21st century educational\n",
      "facilities for our children, as well as to serve as a catalyst for the revitalization\n",
      "of the communities that surround those schools.  This is achieved through\n",
      "maximizing access to employment for minority women and local residents,\n",
      "access to contracting opportunities for small and minority and women-owned\n",
      "and local businesses, and also through producing tangible benefits for the\n",
      "neighborhoods where these schools will be sited. \n",
      "                  The Committee has asked for recommendations as to how to\n",
      "improve the operation of the State’s construction program.  I’m here to stress\n",
      "that while a number of early steps have been taken that hold promise for\n",
      "maximizing the potential of this program much more can be done.  Some of\n",
      "the initial promising steps include the aggregation of the one-half of 1 percent\n",
      "of this construction expenditure toward the training of minorities and women. \n",
      "This will result in up to $30 million that can be used for training. \n",
      "                  The development of pilot preapprenticeship programs that ensure\n",

      "a good first step on early review.  But I raise the caution that streamlining\n",

      "including items like early information on the bidding processes, streamline\n",
      "certification processes, access to capital, particularly equity capital, mentoring,\n",
      "bonding programs, technical assistance, breaking down of contracts to a level\n",
      "that allow additional access, and other supports, those programs remain\n",
      "incomplete.  They need to be fully developed and coordinated and provided\n",
      "with adequate funding and other resources on a long-term basis in a fashion\n",
      "similar to what’s been done for the employment training programs.  The initial\n",
      "outline for those programs has been sort of on the books for over a year.  \n",
      "                  Second, the effective operation of these programs require and can\n",
      "only be determined with adequate information.  In that regard, we recommend\n",
      "the development of data collection systems and monitoring systems for the\n",
      "affirmative action hiring and contracting programs and that the result of that\n",
      "monitoring be made publicly available and that it be made publicly available\n",
      "in a timely fashion.\n",
      "                  And finally, we recommend that the contractor selection process\n",
      "include the affirmative action hiring and contracting plans, and that those\n",
      "plans be waived in the contractor evaluation process.  In addition, that process\n",
      "can recognize unions and contractors that hire graduates of State funded\n",
      "preapprenticeship programs.  \n",

      "on the apprenticeship.  \n",
      "                  But when you talk about training, let me just say this.  The unions\n",
      "can be very slick when it comes to us.  Number one, they said we don’t read\n",
      "nor write well enough to get a book, so even if we train.  Some of us may not\n",

      "whatever reason.  Union contractors or maybe union contractors are small, but\n",
      "to find they do better without it.  So we better be very cautious.  We have to\n",
      "insist that if project labor agreement is going (indiscernible).  We cannot let\n",
      "project labor agreement or our brothers and sisters that we support in the\n",

      "you’re not going to exclude those who don’t choose to participate in your\n",
      "programs or your labor, particularly if they live in our towns and their kids go\n",
      "to our system, and they’re products of that town.  \n",
      "                  That’s the biggest problem that I have.  It’s wonderful for the labor\n",
      "unions to come and get organizations like yours and other people and network\n",
      "and say, “We’re doing this wonderful thing for you.”  But remember, that’s\n",
      "what they told us in 1964, “They were doing this wonderful thing for us.”  It’s\n",
      "always, to be quite frank, African-Americans in particular, that everybody is\n",
      "doing a wonderful thing for.  And if we don’t like the wonderful thing, we have\n",
      "a fight on our hands.  So I just want to be clear that--  The journeyman\n",
      "process, for example, I tried to help some locals.  And they said, “Well, you\n",
      "have to take a journeyman with every four or five apprentices.”  They said a\n",
      "journeyman is like an the instructor and an oversighter.  By the time they get\n",
      "ready to do a job, they come back and said, “No, we meant to tell you have to\n",
      "take five journeyman for one apprentice.”  Well, that doesn’t make any sense. \n",
      "Why do I need five teachers for one person?  I understand in that journeyman\n",
      "area, okay, there are more dollars involved, and we’re not the journeyman\n",
      "person doing the instructions.  \n",
      "                  So there’s little things like that that Joe Citizen or the average\n",
      "worker or even people maybe from your perspective is not aware of the\n",
      "interworking of labor and the impact they can have on us.  The majority of\n",
      "these major projects are going to wind up being in my estimation to some\n",
      "degree union jobs, but it cannot be at the exclusion of local residents.  I don’t\n",
      "care if it’s pushing a wheelbarrow or being a carpenter, and there shouldn’t be\n",
      "the union criteria, “You’re not in my program,” or “You can’t read and write,”\n",
      "because these are prevailing wage jobs in most cases anyway.  \n",
      "                  So I want to be on the record with that because politically\n",
      "legislators agree with me.  They say, “We’re going to run next year, and they’re\n",
      "going to run us out.”  Well, if people don’t run you out if you’re doing the right\n",
      "thing.  If you go to the street for the people not working, they’re going to be\n",
      "the one to support you in the first place.  So it’s got to be a balance more for\n",

      "                  MS. BROWN:  I’d be happy to.  Of course, it depends on how one\n",

      "coming through our preapprenticeship program, and what it offers is exposure\n",
      "to the 15 building trades in Essex County and instruction by many of the\n",

      "that have -- and I appreciate what Senator Rice is saying -- have in the past\n",
      "barred us from joining the apprentice programs that unions offer.  Those four\n",

      "                  MS. BROWN:  The exam is a sort of basic, adult education level\n",

      "for 17 years.  I’ve worked in vocational and technical training now for nearly\n",
      "30 years.  We have made some very strong efforts to work towards recruiting\n",
      "minorities in a number of programs that I have.  What we have found is there\n",
      "has been for a variety of reasons a reluctance of minorities to come into\n",

      "bit lack of trust that they just don’t believe that they’re going to be treated\n",
      "appropriately or fairly.  Hopefully, those kinds of things will change, but there\n",
      "is such a demand in some of the technical trades, especially with a lot of this\n",
      "work that’s going on that we have actually gone out and I have actually had all\n",
      "of my brochures printed in Spanish to go out and try to recruit in the Hispanic\n",
      "community.  \n",
      "                  We have made some -- we are hiring a marketing firm to go out\n",

      "                  SENATOR RICE:  Is it possible you can send, through the Chair,\n",
      "a list of participants who have graduated so far and where they basically live? \n",
      "And let me say this to you.  I’ve talked to labor, and they’ve said, “Well, you\n",
      "know, our training center is down there.  We won’t provide transportation to\n",
      "the job because they have responsibilities.”  Well, that’s wonderful to say, but\n",
      "you can’t do it yourself unless you have some income, etc.  So little things that\n",
      "need to be tightened up in this whole process -- and I just want to at least\n",
      "indicate that.  And there’s distrust, and then there’s this question about a\n",
      "person’s background.  Well, a person’s background shouldn’t be a barrier if\n",
      "you’ve worked in outside in many cases.  New construction is going to start\n",

      "residents, we want to do it, we want to participate.  \n",
      "                  Your average Camden resident that is an activist is probably also\n",
      "on 15 or more boards.  I will say that as a relatively new resident in the city,\n",
      "I’m already on about 4.  So we’re stretched to keep in touch and to participate\n",
      "fully in all the processes of government, and we try to do that.  That’s one of\n",
      "the reasons this project is so important to Camden because it gives an\n",
      "opportunity to make the community habitable to people who can participate\n",
      "on all levels.  We are working with everyone who will work with us to do that. \n",
      "                  We’re talking to a lot of people who’ve been neglected for a long\n",
      "time.  There are a couple things mentioned today that I hope you can consider. \n",
      "One is welfare reform has had a dramatic impact, and one of the ways it’s had\n",
      "an impact has been that people have been outreached to you that maybe\n",
      "government hasn’t touched in a very long time.  Two, some very positive\n",
      "results.  So far people who have been outreached to do want employment. \n",
      "They try mightily, and we’ve heard today quite a few of the obstacles to the\n",
      "implementation of that, but the unemployment rate is maybe half of what it\n",
      "was when welfare reform started.  I applaud those efforts of the government\n",
      "too.  I believe it’s mostly because of the interaction with government agencies\n",
      "and actual residents.  That hasn’t happened in a very long time.  \n",
      "                  On the apprenticeship programs, I encourage there to be some\n",
      "consideration that some of that money be able to be spent in jails and prisons\n",
      "because you have no more captive audience that you can clearly identify as\n",
      "being residents of some of the Abbott districts that are incarcerated, and that\n",
      "would be an ideal time to do some training that could lead to some real life\n",
      "changes for people who could have employment when they come out of\n",
      "incarcerated facilities.  There’s no use of wasting that time to help people\n",
      "improve many skills, get drivers licenses, be able to participate fully.\n",
      "                  The three things that we hear constantly about implementation of\n",
      "the school facilities are the jobs and employment opportunities are very critical\n",
      "to residents.  We’re starting to talk about project labor agreements and what\n",
      "that might mean.  I think that we’re really -- and to echo what Senator Baer\n",
      "said, we’re really only at the very beginning of how that’s going to work out. \n",
      "I will say focused State attention to Camden would be very important in that\n",
      "regard because essentially we are rebuilding the South Jersey Building Trades\n",
      "Council, which most construction work in South Jersey has not been lenient\n",
      "outside of Atlantic City.  I believe we have some unique opportunities in\n",
      "Camden and our other Abbott district, which I should mention, Gloucester\n",
      "City, which is right next door, to help rebuild a working relationship with\n",
      "residents and with the labor unions, whether it be currently existing unions.  \n",
      "                  We have been working all alone with our apprenticeship\n",
      "coordinator at the county level and with the New Jersey Department of Labor\n",
      "to try to figure out how these programs can fit.  It’s difficult, and it’s taken us\n",
      "several years to get a trust level with all those levels.  So I think we also realize\n",
      "that this is going to be a process of three to five to ten years.  We also do not\n",
      "want to tell residents that their homes may be taken for construction when\n",
      "that construction may not yet be set to occur.  That’s the other problem about\n",
      "timing.  You have timing with when you purchase the land, because it’s not fair\n",
      "to a 75-year-old woman today to say, “We may take your house to build a new\n",

      "                  I wanted to say -- perhaps it’s very good that I’m the last because\n",
      "my testimony is going to be slightly different than other peoples.  I have been\n",
      "doing this for 33 years for the League.  So I’ve been around since this all\n",
      "started and have been involved in it.  I’d like to remind all of us to think that\n",
      "this isn’t a 4- or a 6-year problem.  This is over a 30-year problem.\n",
      "                  The first court case in 1973, Robinson v. Cahill -- the courts said at\n",
      "that time, “Facilities were an issue of constitutional import, and we needed to\n",
      "do something about facilities in the poor districts.”  That was in 1973.  We’re\n",
      "almost three decades later.  From 1973 to 1990, we really didn’t have any\n",
      "serious effort whatsoever to address the facilities needs in our poorer urban\n",
      "school districts.  Schools were more overcrowded and the conditions affecting\n",
      "the children got much worse.  In addition, our expectations of the kind of\n",
      "education that children should have just ratcheted up during that period of\n",
      "time.  But the facilities available to those children in those kinds of things were\n",
      "not there.  \n",
      "                  I happened to work for NJIT during that period of time, and we\n",
      "worked with many of the school districts there, particularly for precollege\n",
      "programs.  They didn’t have laboratories.  They didn’t have libraries.  They\n",
      "don’t have the things that are absolutely essential, and that hasn’t changed. \n",
      "That hasn’t changed.  So we continued on.\n",
      "                  In 1990, the Supreme Court spoke again in Abbott II and it\n",
      "repeated, “There are constitutional implications to the issue of school\n",
      "facilities.”  They were part of a thorough and efficient education, but they said\n",
      "they couldn’t act because they had no record upon which they could act.  \n",
      "                  From 1990 to 1996 there are attempts, serious attempts, to\n",
      "increase the amount of State aid for school facilities.  Because I participated in,\n",
      "and I’m sure some of you did too, but we were mainly unsuccessful.  We did\n",
      "manage to get some from the economic development when we worried -- when\n",
      "we were in the recession there, we managed to put some money in, but\n",
      "basically, very little money and virtually none for the poor Abbott districts.\n",
      "                  And then we had in 1994 a freeze on facilities aid at the ’92 level\n",
      "which lasted for five years.  And by the end of that time, facilities aid going out\n",
      "was less than 50 percent of what the districts were eligible for.  Okay.  We\n",
      "came from ’94 to ’96.  We studied how we were going to have a new school\n",
      "funding system.  It took two years.  I listened to, I testified, multiple meetings. \n",
      "We got to what?  We passed it.  You passed it.  The governor signed it in\n",
      "December 1996, and they didn’t do anything about school facilities.  Nothing. \n",
      "                  Immediately thereafter, the Education Law Center went back to\n",
      "court again.  The League of Women Voters, as it had done since 1985, entered\n",
      "as an amicus, but this time, at my urging and through the League of Women\n",
      "Voters, we said, “Those millions of children going through that, the school\n",
      "districts there, cannot get a decent education without school facilities.”  So it\n",
      "was the League of Women Voters who developed the record that the court\n",
      "needed to act on.  It was the League of Women Voters that came up with the\n",
      "constitutional reasoning as to why the court could and should act under the\n",
      "new school aid law.  And indeed they did in May 1997.  That’s more than five\n",
      "years ago.  Elation.  Joy.  Fantastic expectations.  I’m now filled with outrage\n",
      "and sorrow because five years later, there isn’t a single school built in those\n",
      "districts.\n",
      "                  Even worse, in 1990 the court said, “You must do something about\n",
      "safety and health conditions.”  It’s now 2002, and they’re just beginning to get\n",
      "them done.  In 1998, the court really ordered and spoke again.  What went\n",
      "wrong?  Why were we in such a mess?  I think I cannot possibly add anything\n",
      "to the testimony you have heard today from the people in the districts about\n",
      "what they are facing and how difficult it is and how they just feel total\n",
      "frustration and inability to carry out their responsibilities.  \n",
      "                  I can say that I think I know some of the reasons why and what\n",
      "I think you have to do and what has to be done in order to get passed that. \n",
      "Unfortunately when this legislation was passed, I and others knew that it was\n",
      "nothing but a recipe for gridlock and inability to actually accomplish anything. \n",
      "                  The Coalition for Our Children’s Schools did a study when it first\n",
      "got started based on under the best possible scenario -- what was the soonest\n",
      "a school could be built in an Abbott district.  Best possible, three years, best\n",
      "possible.  It’s two years later.  That scenario is now out to five years, because\n",
      "we built in multiple layers and overlapping layers in a bureaucratic nightmare. \n",
      "We haven’t solved that problem at all, yet.  First of all, we only thought there\n",
      "were two levels of bureaucracy.  We thought it was going to be the Department\n",
      "of Education and EDA.  It ended up that the Attorney General’s Office ended\n",
      "up having a veto power that nobody anticipated that kicked in and stopped\n",
      "everything dead and sent it all back to square one again.\n",
      "                  So it’s very very upsetting.  So we that, and I think that we should\n",
      "recognize -- and after the testimony you’ve had today, I think you do recognize\n",
      "it.  But let’s act on it.  That the reason we’ve failed and in the drawing of that\n",
      "legislation was because there was a -- what can I call it -- continuing attitude\n",
      "by the administration of mistrust and distrust of the people in the school\n",
      "districts.  By that, I mean the pay people and, obviously, also their boards of\n",
      "education.  And because of that, they designed a system that did not accept,\n",
      "mistrusted what they said, ignored their experience, and left two competing\n",
      "organizations with none of the interaction that was necessary.  \n",
      "                  I think we recognize, all of us now, how bad it’s been and what it\n",
      "has done and that it’s pushed up our cost immeasurably because it’s taken so\n",
      "long to do it, and it’s crunched everything together.  The League of Women\n",
      "Voters is very pleased that the governor put out his executive order yesterday. \n",
      "The points that he makes seemed to address many or most of the issues that\n",
      "we’ve been concerned about.  But the thing that you must now look at and you\n",
      "must be pushing for and you must be sure of just one thing, and that’s to ask\n",
      "this question.  Does that plan in its implementation provide sufficient power\n",
      "and sufficient change to break down and break through the immense barriers\n",
      "and barricades that were set up by the legislation?  \n",
      "                  If it does, then we have an opportunity to get past this and to get\n",
      "those schools built and children where they belong in high-quality schools\n",
      "where they can get the kind of education they need to become productive\n",
      "citizens.  If it doesn’t, you, the Legislature, the governor’s got invested in this --\n",
      "you, the Legislature, have got to be the watchdogs and the pushers to say, “It\n",
      "isn’t happening.  It’s not working.”  Let’s make changes in the legislation, and\n",
      "do whatever is necessary to move this process forward.  We’ve lost five years. \n",
      "We can’t afford to lose any more.\n",
      "                  Thank you so much.\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN DORIA:  Thank you.\n",
      "                  Are there any questions for Ms. Cambria?\n",

      "long hearing, but I think it’s been a profitable one.  We’ve learned a lot.  I\n",
      "know I have.  I want to thank all the members of the Committee, the Senators\n",
      "who are here present, and the members of the Assembly Education Committee,\n",
      "Co-Chair, Assemblyman Craig Stanley for their attendance and participation\n",
      "and attention.  I think it is very important.\n",

      "of people here present, including Caren Franzini, the Commissioner of\n",
      "Education, Commissioner Librera, and we’ve asked for a representative from\n",
      "the Attorney General’s Office, and also we will have someone from DCA.  So\n",

      "today answered tomorrow.  \n",

      "tomorrow, since he’s going to be sort of playing a major role?\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN DORIA:  Honestly, to be honest, we only found\n",
      "out he existed yesterday afternoon.  So we have not invited him.  I don’t know\n",

      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN DORIA:  And Senator.\n",
      "                  SENATOR RICE:  Yes.  Let me once again thank you for bringing\n",
      "this meeting together today.  As you know, as chair of a joint committee, I\n",
      "have requested that the Joint Committee meet and had that happened, it may\n",
      "have been a little later in the time frame.  These issues brought out today gave\n",
      "us a chance not only to listen but to make it clear to the organization that’s\n",
      "obviously involved and will be involved long term with whatever interest they\n",
      "may have, some of our feelings about the things that maybe they have never\n",
      "heard from us.  \n",
      "                  It is clear to me that two things are imminent in terms of possible\n",
      "changes, that there definitely has to be monitoring through this whole process. \n",
      "And one is to a process that makes sure that everything happens a lot more\n",
      "expedient with the proper oversight and keeping integrity in the process.  And\n",
      "the other thing that’s clear to me, if no one else, is that we’re going to have to\n",
      "really watchdog and be on a regular base of accountability for minority women\n",
      "and local participation as this process goes, recognizing the importance of\n",
      "project labor agreement, but also recognizing the pitfalls of project labor\n",
      "agreements and attitudes of some leaders who indicate they want participation,\n",
      "when in reality they don’t.  \n",
      "                  I’ll be here tomorrow.  I’m going to try to stay the whole day.  I\n",
      "know I have to leave town for my wife’s sake, but I will be here.  And then for\n",
      "the members of the Joint Committee, I want to thank you for having us come\n",
      "along.  We will be meeting.  A memo went out to the Joint Committee or will\n",
      "be going out.  Hopefully, we’ll meet as a joint committee at least once a month\n",
      "if we’re serious about this and hope those subcommittees can meet prior to or\n",
      "after so that we can get a lot of work done on this whole Abbott situation.\n",
      "                  So once again, Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN DORIA:  Thank you very much, Senator Rice.\n",
      "                  Yes.\n",
      "                  Assemblyman Stanley.\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN STANLEY:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n",
      "                  Again, I too want to thank you and congratulate you on holding\n",
      "this hearing.  One of the things that I think was invaluable is the fact that\n",
      "district people could come and actually share with this Committee without fear\n",
      "of reprisal the truth about what is going on currently with respect to school\n",
      "construction and give us an opportunity to assess the situation and take\n",
      "corrective action if need be.  I think probably one of the most immediate\n",
      "benefits that will come out of this hearing is that some of those projects, that\n",
      "perhaps a word from myself or Senator Rice may be able to break a logjam or\n",
      "two and maybe some of those kids who would not have gotten that laboratory\n",
      "or those windows put in or those things that need to be done will, in fact, be\n",
      "able to get those things in time for the coming school year. \n",
      "                  But again, Mr. Chairman, I thank you.  I think this has been\n",
      "invaluable.  I’m looking forward to tomorrow.  And thank all the members of\n",
      "the Committee who participated, and particularly the Joint Committee\n",
      "personnel as well.  Thank you.\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN DORIA:  Assemblyman Conners.\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN CONNORS:  Mr. Chairman, thanks very much.\n",
      "                  It’s been a very interesting day.  I think I was particularly\n",
      "impressed with the Irvington presentation, because at the beginning you were\n",
      "asking not only for people to recite their problems that they’re dealing with,\n",
      "but also to come up with some suggestions on resolving them.  I think Mr.\n",
      "Bloom and Mr. Steele -- and I forget the other gentleman’s name -- came up\n",
      "with some great suggestions that I’ve been reading through.  But the one\n",
      "gentleman, I don’t what his name--  It was Mr. Bloom, Mr. Steele, and I don’t--\n",
      "                  SENATOR RICE:  Victor Demming.\n",
      "                  ASSEMBLYMAN CONNORS:  Victor.  He talked about the\n",
      "quality of people.  I think where he was coming from is that the people are --\n",
      "they’re there.  They’re in Burlington City that I represent that’s an Abbott\n",
      "district.  There are tremendously qualified people, just as there--  I know there’s\n",
      "people in Camden that we talked about earlier, and I know there’s people in\n",
      "Irvington that can do the job, that can get it done.  \n",
